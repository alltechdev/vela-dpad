# Target device matrix - D-pad + small-screen support

This fork's reason to exist is 100% D-pad operation on real feature phones. This folder tracks
every device we commit to supporting, with the exact screen geometry to test against and the
per-device findings (with screenshots).

**Scope caveat (read this):** all results here are from **SIMULATING** the screen size (`wm size` /
`wm density`) on a test device - **nothing has run on the actual phones**, so real-hardware quirks are
unconfirmed. And "verified" below means the **core surfaces** (first-run flow, bare map, search, place
sheet, directions, Settings) fit and are D-pad-navigable at that simulated size - NOT full D-pad
coverage of every screen. Targets collapse to two sizes (240x320 and 480x854), so a phone's status is
its size's status.

## How to test a device (as a REAL user, verified VISUALLY)

Feature phones are BOTH tiny-screen AND D-pad-only, so both must hold at the device's real size.

1. Emulate the device geometry on any test phone:
   `adb shell wm size <WxH>; adb shell wm density <dpi>` (restore with `wm size reset; wm density reset`).
2. Drive it as a REAL user - do NOT pre-set prefs to skip onboarding. A fresh install shows Welcome,
   the voice/offline prompts, and the "Help improve Vela?" diagnostics consent BEFORE the map; those
   are D-pad + small-screen surfaces too and must pass. `adb shell pm clear app.vela.debug` to reset
   to a true first-run.
3. D-pad only: `adb shell input keyevent` 19/20/21/22 (arrows), 23 (OK), 4 (BACK).
4. VERIFY VISUALLY: `adb exec-out screencap -p > frame.png` and LOOK - focus ring present and on the
   right element, nothing clipped off-screen, text readable. `uiautomator` cannot see some Compose
   screens (the search overlay dumps as a single node), so the screenshot is the ground truth, not a
   focus dump or a passing script.
5. Save frames under `tests/devices/<model>/screenshots/` and record what works / what's broken in
   the model's `findings.md`.

The scripted auditor `tests/small_screen/audit_smallscreen.sh` defaults to the smallest target and
takes `VELA_SMALL=WxH VELA_SMALL_DPI=<dpi>` to sweep each device.

## Devices

| Model | Screen | Resolution | Orientation | ~dpi (density) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Kyocera e4810](kyocera-e4810/findings.md) | 2.6" | 240x320 | portrait | ~154 (160) | FULLY COVERED (20/20) | own full_coverage run; frames in `kyocera-e4810/screenshots/full/` |
| [TCL Flip 2](tcl-flip-2/findings.md) | 2.8" | 240x320 | portrait | ~143 (160) | FULLY COVERED (20/20) | own full_coverage run; frames in `tcl-flip-2/screenshots/full/` |
| [Sonim XP3 (XP3800)](sonim-xp3/findings.md) | 2.6" | 240x320 | portrait | ~154 (160) | FULLY COVERED (20/20) | own full_coverage run; frames in `sonim-xp3/screenshots/full/` |
| [Kyocera DuraXV](kyocera-duraxv/findings.md) | - | 240x320 | portrait | ~160 | FULLY COVERED (20/20) | own full_coverage run; frames in `kyocera-duraxv/screenshots/full/` |
| [Sonim X320 (XP3 Plus 5G)](sonim-x320/findings.md) | 2.95" | 480x854 | portrait | ~332 (320) | FULLY COVERED (20/20) | driven at 480x854@320; AdaptiveDensity generalizes |
| Sonim X320 @ low density (sonim-x320-225) | 2.95" | 480x854 | portrait | **225** | PARTIAL | same panel, user-reported low-density setup; declutter / Options+Park / parking verified in `sonim-x320/screenshots/full-dens225/`; full run pending |
| Kyocera DuraXe e4830 (kyocera-duraxe-e4830) | - | 240x320 | portrait | **120** | PARTIAL | tester-reported (jtechforums); wider in dp than the 160-dpi 240x320 profiles. Options→Layers verified at this density; full run pending |

Status meaning: FULLY COVERED (20/20) = a full `full_coverage.sh <id>` run at that profile's simulated
geometry reported 20 COVERED, 0 MISSED (all surfaces: first-run x4, bare map, search x2, place x2,
directions x2, Settings x5 including the deep Offline and Saved places sections, voice search, parking
x3) and the frames were checked by eye. Every committed profile now runs as its OWN row in the gate -
no profile stands in for another, even at the same geometry. Still simulated geometry on a test phone,
not real hardware.

Every target so far is **240x320 portrait** (the "320x240" written on some spec sheets is the same
panel in portrait). So the auditor default (240x320) covers them all; densities differ slightly with
physical size but all round to ~160. More models will be added as they are named. Goal: perfect D-pad
+ screen-size compatibility across all of them.

## Tooling

- **`bash tests/devices/full_coverage.sh <id>`** - the FULL-COVERAGE gate. Drives EVERY surface
  (first-run + all dialogs, bare map, search + results, place sheet + expanded, directions + steps,
  Settings + sub-screens: Voice library / Offline / Saved places) at the device's simulated geometry,
  captures a labeled screenshot of each into `<id>/screenshots/full/`, and prints a COVERED/MISSED
  checklist. **A device is "fully supported" only when this reports FULLY COVERED (0 MISSED) and you
  have looked at the frames** (AGENTS.md hard rule). Content surfaces need live search+routing - run
  with the network up and a mock GPS fix over any city that has data (`VELA_LAT=<lat> VELA_LNG=<lng>`,
  defaults to a built-in one).
  - **Per-feature phases - never run FULL just to test one feature.** The gate is phased:
    `PHASES="<names>" bash tests/devices/full_coverage.sh <id>` re-captures only those surface
    groups, writing the same numbered frames and leaving the rest in place. Current phases:
    `firstrun map search place directions settings voice parking`. **Rule: every new feature adds
    its surfaces as its OWN phase in the same PR**, so verifying it on any device is one short
    reproducible run - the FULL tour stays reserved for the fully-supported verdict.
  - **HARD RULE - every target geometry, every time.** A phase is verified only when it has run
    green AND its frames were checked by eye at EVERY geometry in the matrix (both 240x320@160 and
    480x854@320 today). One size never stands in for the other; a new geometry joins the loop the
    day it lands in the matrix.
- **`bash tests/devices/self_coverage.sh <id>`** - the IN-PROCESS self-coverage tour: ~10x faster
  than the external gate for its surfaces and stricter (real focus assertions, exact clip bounds,
  direct flavor assertions), same sources of truth (accessibility + real framebuffer stills + real
  key input, R8-minified build), scrcpy recording per run. Augments the external gates - they stay
  mandatory until a surface is covered here strictly better. `VELA_PKG=app.vela.restricted.debug`
  runs it against the restricted flavor.
- **`bash tests/devices/capture.sh <id>`** - lighter AUTO-capture of the first-run flow + core surfaces
  into `<id>/screenshots/auto/` (`--warm` skips the fresh `pm clear`; `capture.sh all` does every
  device). Use `full_coverage.sh` for the support gate; `capture.sh` for a quick visual refresh.
- **`bash tests/small_screen/run_matrix.sh`** - runs `audit_smallscreen.sh` at EVERY target geometry
  (240x320@160 and 480x854@320) and prints a per-geometry PASS/FAIL summary. Use it to confirm every
  density level is green in one shot.
- The auditors auto-detect the installed build (`app.vela` vs `app.vela.debug`), retry the uiautomator
  dump when it races an animation, verify the app actually reached the foreground, and warm up cold
  starts - so a passing run means the app, not the harness.

## Adding a target device

1. Add a row to the table above (model, screen, resolution, orientation, ~dpi/density).
2. Add its geometry to the `DEVICES` table in `capture.sh` and (if a new size) the `GEOMS` list in
   `tests/small_screen/run_matrix.sh`.
3. `mkdir tests/devices/<id>` and add a `findings.md` (copy an existing one).
4. Run `capture.sh <id>` and `run_matrix.sh`, then VERIFY the screenshots by eye and record results in
   the findings. Same-geometry devices can reference the reference device's findings (see TCL Flip 2).
