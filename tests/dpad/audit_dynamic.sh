# tests/dpad/audit_dynamic.sh — EXHAUSTIVE on-device D-pad auditor.
#
# Drives to EVERY reachable surface and stress-tests the invariants that MUST hold everywhere:
#   (1) opens focused     — a primary element is focused on open (no wasted keypress); the bare map
#                           is the one ambient exception (first arrow -> search bar).
#   (2) focus never lost  — a full multi-axis (DOWN/RIGHT + UP/LEFT) traversal always leaves
#                           SOMETHING focused (a settle-confirmed null = a dead-end / trap), and
#                           reaches multiple DISTINCT elements (a stuck traversal is a reachability gap).
#   (3) no trap           — BACK returns to the previous surface.
# Nothing escapes: a surface that opens unfocused, drops focus in ANY direction, or won't BACK out
# fails. Deep/network-bound surfaces self-skip. Complements audit_static.sh (structural) and
# audit_dialogs.sh (small-screen). "You must get everything" — cover every surface you can reach.
