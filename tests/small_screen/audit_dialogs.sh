# Shrinks the display to a feature-phone size and verifies that a dialog shows ALL of its content
# and BUTTONS without clipping any off-screen — the buttons must stay on-screen and focus-reachable
# even when the body is tall (it must scroll, not shove the buttons past the bottom edge). This is
# the on-device counterpart to audit_static.sh's "every Dialog has a scroll container" check, and it
# targets the tester's Qin-F21-class tiny screens (user 2026-07-08).
#
#   ./audit_dialogs.sh          # runs; restores the original screen size on exit
