/**
 * The shared frame for every Settings page (the hub and each sub-screen): a back-button TopAppBar
 * over a scrolling Column. It carries, in ONE place, the hard-won D-pad focus plumbing the old
 * single-page Settings had inline (docs/dpad.md, both halves device-found at 240x320):
 *
 *  - The page opens ALREADY FOCUSED on the Back button, via a settle-window retry loop (below)
 *    that is STRONGER than `dpadAutoFocus(requester)`: it keeps re-requesting when focus lands and
 *    is then STOLEN by the soft-key bar teardown's window-focus churn, not just until the first
 *    land. A page that places initial focus elsewhere (the hub restoring focus to the row you came
 *    back from) passes [autoFocusBack] = false - the Back button keeps its requester so the UP
 *    bridge still works, it just doesn't grab focus on open.
 *  - DOWN from Back ENTERS the content: Compose's directional search can't cross the TopAppBar ->
 *    Column boundary and CLEARS focus instead, so Back routes DOWN straight to the first content
 *    row via requestFocus (never moveFocus, which clears at a container edge). The content lambda
 *    receives that bridge as [topRow] - ATTACH IT to the page's FIRST focusable control.
 *  - UP from the top content row routes back to Back (the mirror trap), gated on the top row
 *    actually holding focus.
 *  - Bare LEFT/RIGHT are swallowed on the Column AND the Back button (`dpadSwallowHorizontal`) - a
 *    no-target horizontal move in a verticalScroll Column clears focus irrecoverably. A horizontal
 *    row of siblings inside must drive its own L/R via `dpadRowSibling` (issue #24).
 *
 * All of it is inert under touch; the touch layout is byte-identical to a plain Scaffold.
