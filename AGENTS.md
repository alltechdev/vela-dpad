# Vela - project guide for Claude

Degoogled Google-Maps replacement for Android (the "NewPipe for Maps"). Open
vector tiles for the basemap; the device scrapes Google's public web endpoints
per-user (no backend, no shared API key) for POIs, routing and traffic-aware
ETAs. Targets GrapheneOS / no-GMS ROMs; F-Droid distribution. GPLv3.

## Docs discipline (read first)

**Every change updates the docs in the same commit.** Hard rule for all
collaborators (human or Claude). When you change behaviour, calibration,
features, or structure, update - in the *same* commit:
- `README.md` - status, architecture, calibrated request/response paths
- `docs/FEATURES.md` - tick/retire the affected items
- `docs/SPEC.md` - the authoritative rebuild spec (architecture / extractor contract /
  resilience / constraints); update when a load-bearing decision or path changes
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - planned work + big bets (opt-in telemetry, Vela's own traffic layer,
  popular times, …); add new ideas here as they come up
- `AGENTS.md` - this file (build rules, layout, gotchas); `CLAUDE.md` is a gitignored symlink to it
- the `project-vela` memory note if a load-bearing fact changed

Stale docs are treated as a bug. Code-only commits are not OK; if a change
genuinely needs no doc edit, say why in the commit.

**Writing style (hard rule): NO EMOJIS, EVER** - not in code, comments, docs, commit
messages, UI strings, or script output. Plain text only. Also no em-dashes; write in a
plain human voice (commit subjects are the user-facing changelog). Use words like `PASS`/
`FAIL`, not pictographs.

## Visual verification (HARD RULE, NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Anything a user can see MUST be verified VISUALLY, by looking at an actual on-device
screenshot - EVERYTHING, every time. No exceptions.** A passing (or failing) test script is
NEVER the final word on UX. This is not optional and not satisfied by audits alone.

- **Scripts are necessary but NOT sufficient.** The `tests/dpad` / `tests/small_screen`
  auditors race the app's focus-recovery timing: identical fresh runs produce DIFFERENT
  failures (search bar focused, then a FAB focused, then a focus-loss that vanishes next run),
  and they report "could not open X" when the surface opens fine by hand. A red script is a
  lead to investigate, not a verdict; a green script is not proof the UI is right. Never
  conclude "it works" or "it's broken" from a script alone.
- **Look at the pixels.** For every UI change or surface touched: `adb exec-out screencap -p`
  (or `adb shell su -c screencap` on a locked/secure screen), pull it, and OPEN it. Confirm
  with your eyes: the change actually rendered; the focus ring is present and on the right
  element; nothing is clipped, overlapping, or off-screen; text is readable and correctly
  inset; both light AND dark themes look right where the change can show in either.
  **`tests/devices/capture.sh <id>` automates this** - it drives the full first-run flow + core
  surfaces at a target device's real geometry and saves labeled screenshots into
  `tests/devices/<id>/screenshots/auto/`, so regenerating the visual proof is one command. It does not
  replace looking - you still open the frames - but it makes the capture reproducible and PR-reviewable.
- **Drive it like a user.** Send real keypresses (D-pad: `input keyevent 19/20/21/22/23`,
  BACK `4`) through the actual flow and screenshot at each step - fresh launch, first arrow,
  each surface, the specific control you changed. Do not trust `uiautomator` focus dumps
  alone (a single snapshot routinely misses the focused node while auto-focus retries across
  frames) - the screenshot is the source of truth.
- **No UI change lands on the word of a script.** If you have not looked at a screenshot of
  the affected surface behaving correctly, the change is not verified. Ship the frames.
- **Calibrate a pixel assertion against a frame you have LOOKED AT, or it will pass on nothing.**
  `ring_walk.sh` asserts the focus ring is visible at every stop. Written with an "orange-ish"
  threshold it counted Vela's own POI pins (227,116,0) as a ring and reported a clean walk across a
  map where nothing was ringed at all - a green result measuring the wrong pixels. The ring is
  exactly `0xFFFF6D00`; matching that colour made 11 of 12 map steps fail immediately and truthfully.
  Sample the real colours out of a saved frame before trusting any colour test, and when a
  screen-scraping check passes first try, suspect it.
- **A "missing control" bug may be a FOCUS bug.** The same walk reported nine ringless controls on
  the place sheet. Every one was really focus sitting in the soft-key bar, which had quietly become
  focusable (`isClickable` implies focusable since API 26). Before adding anything to a control that
  "has no ring", confirm the control is what actually holds focus - the frame shows it, a focus dump
  often does not.
- **"The code for it already exists" is not a fix, and can hide the bug.** Issue #79 reported
  that voice does not expand road abbreviations. `EN_SPEECH_WORDS` had expanded them since
  2026-07-03, so the report looked stale. It was not: running the real function over real road
  names showed it MIS-expanding - "St Louis Ave" came out **"Street Louis Avenue"** and
  "Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd" came out "Drive Martin Luther King". A user hearing that
  reports it exactly the way they did. **When a report contradicts the code, run the code over
  real-world inputs before believing the code.** For anything table-driven (abbreviations,
  romanization, unit formatting) that means a throwaway probe printing input => output for a
  dozen realistic cases, including the ones where the same token means two different things.
  Whatever the probe catches becomes a permanent test before the probe is deleted.

## Prove the check CAN fail (HARD RULE, NO EXCEPTIONS)

The section above says look at the pixels. This one is about a different and worse failure: a check
that **cannot fail**, and therefore proves nothing while reporting success. Every wrong "it's fixed"
in the #79 round came from one of these, and each looked green.

- **Run the check against the BROKEN state first. No negative control, no claim.** Before trusting a
  new script, harness or assertion, run it where the bug is still present - the previous build, a
  reverted file, a deliberately wrong input - and confirm it FAILS. `ring_walk.sh` reported a clean
  walk across a map where nothing was ringed, because it matched "orange-ish" and Vela's own POI pins
  are orange. One baseline run against the unswept build turned that into 11 failures out of 12 and
  exposed the bug in the checker within a minute. **A check first exercised on the fixed state is
  indistinguishable from a check that always passes.** If you cannot make it fail on purpose, you do
  not yet know what it measures.
- **Test against CAPTURED input, not imagined input.** A unit test written from your belief about the
  data can only confirm that belief. The first exit-direction fix read `OFF_RAMP_RIGHT` tokens and had
  a green test; a live capture showed the feed sends a bare `OFF_RAMP` with no side, so the fix was
  aimed at a shape that never arrives and the test was green about nothing. For anything parsing a
  remote feed: capture a REAL response (log it off the device), assert against that, and say in the
  commit which capture and when. Google's keyless payloads drift - a fixture with a date beats
  confident prose.
- **Re-read the diff you just called finished, before anyone asks.** Both defects in the geometry pass
  - ramps and forks sharing an icon family, and a single sample that could point confidently the wrong
  way - were plainly visible in code already declared done and gate-green. They were found by a reread
  prompted by "PERFECT?", which means they were findable without it. **Declaring done is the trigger
  for the reread, not the end of the work.**
- **Doctrine is not measurement.** docs/dpad.md says buttons and chips need `DpadRingBox`; that
  justified converting 12 more sites. Measuring on device first showed a bare `dpadHighlight` on a 40dp
  button renders identically (ring 52px, slack 13/9/32/31 either way) - the wrapper matters at 32dp,
  not 40dp. Twelve edits and twelve chances to break layout, avoided by one measurement. When a rule
  tells you to change working code, measure the thing the rule is about before you change it.
- **Prefer a gate to a promise.** Written rules did not stop these: "verify visually, NO EXCEPTIONS"
  was already in this file while a wrong-pixel check was shipping. What actually held the line was
  mechanical - `BUTTON_RING_SWEPT` making a missing ring a build failure, and the auditor rule that
  turned a hand-found bug into something that cannot regress. When you fix a class of bug, spend the
  extra few minutes teaching a gate to catch it; prose in this file is the weakest form of the fix.

## Feature-phone display size (HARD RULE, NO EXCEPTIONS)

D-pad-first means feature-phone-first, and feature phones are SMALL. "Works with a D-pad" must hold
at a FEATURE-PHONE display size, not only on your dev phone's native panel. Non-negotiable:

- **The app adapts its own density to the screen (`ui/AdaptiveDensity.kt`).** Standard Material
  layouts assume ~360dp of logical width; a 240px feature phone is far below that and controls
  crowd/clip. `AdaptiveDensity.wrap` (chained with `AppLocale.wrap` in both
  MainActivity/VelaApp.`attachBaseContext`) overrides the effective `densityDpi` so a small screen
  reports at least `MIN_WIDTH_DP` (360) of width - fixing clipping across EVERY screen in one place.
  It ONLY shrinks small screens (>= 360dp wide = byte-for-byte no-op), device-verified: at 240x320 all
  three category chips fit where before only one did. `MIN_WIDTH_DP` is tuned VISUALLY (smaller text is
  the cost) - re-verify on-screen if you change it. NB density fixes LAYOUT/clipping, not focus - the
  D-pad focus rules below are separate.
- **"Fully supported" is a HARD REQUIREMENT, not a vibe.** You may call a device (or its screen size)
  FULLY SUPPORTED only when **EVERY screen** is reachable, opens focused, is D-pad-navigable, and is
  clip-free at that device's screen size - **verified VISUALLY by screenshot**, not by a passing script
  alone. "Every screen" means the WHOLE app, not a core subset: first-run (Welcome + every onboarding
  dialog), bare map, search overlay + results, place sheet + expanded + reviews + overflow menu,
  directions + route alternates + steps, turn-by-turn navigation cards, transit, AND every Settings
  section + sub-screen (Voice library, Offline, Saved places, Diagnostics, ...), plus every menu/dialog.
  The reproducible gate is **`tests/devices/full_coverage.sh <id>`** - it drives every surface at the
  device's simulated size, captures a labeled screenshot of each, and prints a COVERED/MISSED checklist;
  a device is fully supported only when it reports **FULLY COVERED (0 MISSED)** and you have LOOKED at
  the frames. Content surfaces (search/place/nav/transit) need live search+routing, so run it with the
  network up - a MISSED row (including network-blocked) means NOT fully supported yet. Until every row
  is covered, the status is "core surfaces at the simulated size", NOT "fully supported" - say so.
  **Everything must be reproducible in scripts** so a NEW phone is added by: a matrix row + its geometry
  in `capture.sh`/`full_coverage.sh`/`run_matrix.sh`, then running them - no bespoke manual steps.
  **The gate is PHASED - and every new feature MUST add its surfaces as its own phase** (in
  `full_coverage.sh`'s `ALLPHASES` + a `phase <name>` block with its own frame numbers, same PR as the
  feature): `PHASES="voice parking" bash tests/devices/full_coverage.sh <id>` re-captures just those
  frames, so verifying one feature on a device never needs the full ~13-min tour. A partial run
  reports PARTIAL, never the FULLY COVERED verdict. Current phases:
  `firstrun map search place directions settings voice parking`.
  **HARD RULE - one surface fails, re-run ONLY that phase, NEVER the whole leg.** A full leg is
  ~13-14 min (~35 min for both geometries); iterating a fix by re-running the whole tour is
  unacceptable waste. `PHASES=<phase> bash tests/devices/full_coverage.sh <id>` runs just that group -
  a light phase (map/place) in ~1-2 min; the `settings` phase is the slow one (~9 min measured at
  240x320) because its three deep sub-sections each dump-per-swipe scroll, so that swipe overhead is
  the real bottleneck to optimize next. Every phase re-establishes its own state (no `pm clear` outside `firstrun`, each does
  `goto_map`; `place`/`directions` re-run search if needed), so any single phase runs standalone as
  long as the app is past first-run. Iterate the fix with `PHASES=<failing-phase>` at the ONE affected
  geometry/flavor; only once it passes, run the full leg (no `PHASES`) ONCE for the verdict. Do NOT
  re-run legs that already passed when the change cannot regress them - reason about blast radius
  first (e.g. a swipe-helper tweak can't regress a leg that already reached the section).
  **The IN-PROCESS self-coverage suite (`app/src/androidTest` SelfTourTest + `tests/devices/
  self_coverage.sh <id>`)** is the fast tour: ~10x quicker than full_coverage.sh for the surfaces
  it covers (36s vs ~6min at 240x320) and STRICTER - real focus-state assertions per D-pad step
  (By.focused(true) - actual focus, not pixel inference), exact pixel-bounds clip checks, and
  direct flavor assertions (restricted rows asserted ABSENT). Accuracy contract, non-negotiable:
  same sources of truth as the external harness (accessibility tree, REAL framebuffer stills incl.
  the GL map via androidx.test Screenshot, REAL system-dispatcher key input via
  UiDevice.pressKeyCode), run against the R8-minified debug build; scrcpy records every run; the
  eyeball pass on the stills stays mandatory; tree-vs-pixels disagreement = failure. Do NOT use the
  Compose test runtime (createAndroidComposeRule) here - it needs Compose-internal classes the
  minified app strips; UiAutomator in-process reads the same accessibility tree without that
  fight. The kotlin/kotlinx-coroutines wholesale keeps in proguard-rules-debug.pro exist FOR this
  suite (the test APK resolves those from the app dex).
  **Migration rule: the existing gates (audit_static, audit_dynamic, small-screen matrix,
  full_coverage) remain MANDATORY until a surface is covered here strictly better - the suite
  AUGMENTS, it does not replace yet. Wrapper gotcha: stills are pulled after EACH geometry (a
  later run's pm clear wipes the app's external files).**

    **HARD RULE - EVERY TARGET GEOMETRY, EVERY TIME, NOTHING LEFT TO CHANCE:** a feature (or phase)
  counts as verified ONLY when its phase has run green AND its frames have been eyeballed at EVERY
  target geometry in the device matrix. **DENSITY IS PART OF THE GEOMETRY, not a detail:** the same
  pixel size at a different dpi is a DIFFERENT dp layout and a different test. Today the matrix is
  `240x320@160`, `480x854@320`, plus the two profiles real users turned up on:
  `240x320@120` (`kyocera-duraxe-e4830`, a tester's phone - ~320dp wide, not 240dp) and
  `480x854@225` (`sonim-x320-225`, a reported low-density setup for the same panel). One size is NOT
  a proxy for another, and one density is not a proxy for another. Run
  `for id in kyocera-e4810 sonim-x320 kyocera-duraxe-e4830 sonim-x320-225; do PHASES="<phase>" bash tests/devices/full_coverage.sh $id; done`
  and look at every set of frames before calling it done. A new geometry OR density added to the
  matrix joins this loop the same day.
    Two extra axes exist and are cheap to sweep, both writing to their own dirs so they can never
  clobber the committed keypad goldens: `SOFTKEYS=off` (the TOUCH layout, proving a soft-key-gated
  change is correctly NOT applied there) and `DENS=<n>` (an ad-hoc density override).
    **HARD RULE - THE FULL VERIFICATION MATRIX, BEFORE EVERY FEATURE PR MERGES (added 2026-07-13
  after it was repeatedly forgotten - do not merge without ALL FOUR cells):**
  1. **Every committed geometry** - DENSITY IS PART OF THE GEOMETRY. As of 2026-07-20 that is FOUR:
     480x854 @320 and @225, 240x320 @160 and @120. The attached device's native size is NOT a
     substitute. Cross that with both flavors and soft-keys on/off and the full product is 16 legs at
     ~20 min each; TRIMMING IS ALLOWED BUT MUST BE REASONED AND STATED - flavor is a
     feature-availability difference rather than a layout one, so restricted can run once per
     screen-size class, and the touch layout does not vary with density beyond that. The round-2 pass
     ran 9 legs on that basis and said so in the PR. What is NOT allowed is dropping a geometry from
     the soft-keys-on legs: that is the axis the layout actually depends on.
  2. **D-pad walk-and-activate** - arrow TO each new interactive element and activate it with OK,
     confirming a visible focus ring and the state change. `audit_static.sh` passing is necessary
     but NOT sufficient - it proves the ring exists, not that the element is reachable/activatable.
     (Check the UI/accessibility state for the effect, not the prefs file - SharedPreferences
     `apply()` writes disk lazily and races a file check into a false failure.)
     **A MENU THAT DRAWS IS NOT A MENU THAT WORKS.** Capturing a popup proves it rendered, nothing
     more. Every entry that opens something must be OPENED in the phase and the result asserted.
     Device-proven the hard way: the bare-map Options menu screenshotted perfectly while its Layers
     entry did nothing at all, and the `softkey` phase scored 8/8 through it for a whole release
     (tester report, Kyocera DuraXe e4830). If a phase captures a menu, it must also activate it.
  3. **BOTH release variants** - standard AND restricted (`assembleRestrictedDebug`): the feature is
     present and working there, or correctly gated, AND the flavor's locks are still intact
     (no Place-pages section etc.).
  4. **Eyeballed screenshots** - a human-readable frame per surface; script assertions alone don't
     count (the verify-visually rule).
  State the matrix results in the PR body. A cell that genuinely cannot run yet (e.g. a HUD that
  only renders while driving) is DECLARED as deferred in the PR, never silently skipped.
  5. **COMMIT the regenerated goldens** - a new feature/surface adds its OWN phase to
     `full_coverage.sh` (rule at the top of that file) AND ships the refreshed `tests/devices/<id>/
     screenshots/` frames in the same PR, so the repo's committed visual baseline stays CURRENT for
     D-pad + small-screen at every geometry. Do not just eyeball local captures and discard them -
     regenerate the affected phase for the golden devices (kyocera-e4810 240x320, sonim-x320
     480x854; restricted sets too if the surface renders there) and commit the PNGs. A reviewer must
     be able to see the new surface's D-pad/small-screen rendering from the PR without a device.
- **Every screen opens focused AND stays D-pad-navigable at a SMALL display, not just native.**
  Verify at a real target size - `adb shell wm size 240x320; adb shell wm density 160` (Kyocera e4810;
  see `tests/devices/`) - by SCREENSHOT: the screen lands a visible focus ring on open AND arrows move
  it row-to-row. Two distinct small-screen focus bugs were device-found and fixed on Settings: (1) the
  weak `rememberDpadAutoFocus` left the Back button UNfocused on open (fixed with robust
  `dpadAutoFocus(requester)`); (2) DOWN from the focused Back button CLEARED focus instead of entering
  the scrolling content (Compose can't cross container boundaries) - fixed with an explicit
  `topRowFocus.requestFocus()` bridge (mirror of the UP-from-top -> Back routing). Both verified by
  screenshot at 240x320. Restore with `wm size reset; wm density reset`. **Sweep EVERY target density
  in one shot** with `tests/small_screen/run_matrix.sh` (runs the small-screen auditor at each geometry
  in the `tests/devices/` matrix); a change must be green at all of them, not just one.
- **The auditors are only trustworthy because of hard-won robustness - keep it.** `PKG` auto-detects
  the installed build (a hardcoded `app.vela` vs the `app.vela.debug` sideload made `launch_fresh`
  launch a NON-existent package and silently drive whatever app was foreground - the root of most
  "flakiness"); `ui_dump` retries when uiautomator returns only the root node mid-animation;
  `launch_fresh` verifies the app reached the foreground; `warm_up` clears cold-start. If an auditor
  result looks wrong, suspect these before the app - but VERIFY against a screenshot either way.
- **Auditors must FAIL, never silently SKIP/PASS, when a core surface can't be reached or focused.**
  A SKIP that doesn't count as a failure is a FALSE PASS: `audit_smallscreen.sh` SKIPped Settings (a
  no-network surface that must always open) and still printed PASS, hiding that Settings was
  unfocusable. Rules the auditors now enforce, and that you must preserve: a core no-network surface
  (bare map, search, Settings) that can't be reached is a FAIL; a full D-pad walk that never focuses
  ANYTHING (`seen==0`) is a FAIL. Only deep/NETWORK-bound surfaces may legitimately skip. **Narrow
  carve-out:** when a surface is genuinely VERIFIED VISUALLY (screenshots committed under
  `tests/devices/`) but the harness can't reliably SCRIPT-navigate to it, emit a NOTE pointing at that
  proof - not a vacuous pass, not a misleading FAIL (the screenshot is the proof; don't burn effort
  perfecting harness navigation for something already verified by eye). Settings on the bare map is the
  standing example.
- **Prefer the robust `dpadAutoFocus()` / `dpadAutoFocus(requester)` over the weak
  `rememberDpadAutoFocus()`** for any screen whose focus target sits in a scroll container or attaches
  a frame or two late. The weak helper bails the instant `requestFocus()` doesn't throw, even when
  focus never landed; the robust one re-requests until `onFocusEvent` confirms it truly landed, then
  stops (so it never fights the user). `audit_static.sh` surfaces every weak use for triage - each must
  be screenshot-verified to actually focus on a small screen, or converted.
- **`dpadModeAutoFocus()` is the variant for HYBRID touch+keypad phones** - it gates on the LIVE
  `rememberDpadMode()` instead of the static device check (which is false on a hybrid by design, so
  the other two no-op there). Used by the bare-map update/notice cards: NO traversal path reaches
  them (the search bar above opens on focus and swallows the way down - a user report proved the
  Update button could never be highlighted), so the top actionable card takes focus itself, and
  acting on a card hands focus to the map target. Sibling rule from the same fix: the info-card
  stack fully occludes the category chips, and occluded chips STILL take focus - a D-pad UP landed
  on an invisible chip and OK fired its search (device-found). Anything a card/sheet fully covers
  must drop out of the focus order (`focusProperties { canFocus = false }`, see `infoCardsShown`).
- **A control that REPLACES itself when used needs a `DpadFocusKeeper`** (Download -> progress ->
  Use/Remove: the Settings voice rows, routing region rows, the voice-search model). Compose clears
  focus when the focused node leaves composition and recovery dumps it at the TOP of the page (user
  report). Pattern: `rememberDpadFocusKeeper()` + `Modifier.dpadFocusKept(keeper)` on every variant
  (a progress-only variant becomes a ringed `.focusable()` stop) + `DpadFocusHandoff(keeper)` inside
  each branch + one `LaunchedEffect(variantKey) { keeper.retarget() }`. The handoff arms on
  "focused at (or within 250 ms of) disposal" because the focus-loss event and onDispose race in
  either order. No-op under touch. Device-verified: Download -> spinner -> Use kept the highlight
  on the row through both swaps.

## The restricted build flavor + the feat/restrictions branch (hard rules)

**WHAT THIS IS (read before touching anything restriction-related):** Vela ships TWO release APKs
from one codebase via the `policy` flavor dimension (`app/build.gradle.kts` `productFlavors`):
- **`standard`** - the app exactly as before. Its behavior must stay BYTE-IDENTICAL: every
  restriction below remains a user-flippable Settings toggle with the same defaults as always.
- **`restricted`** - for users who impose the restrictions on themselves and want them
  NON-OPTIONAL. The five self-restriction toggles are HARD-LOCKED at their restrictive values and
  their Settings rows are REMOVED (the whole Place pages section disappears): reviews OFF,
  "Read all reviews" page OFF, photos OFF, adult categories HIDDEN, website/external links HIDDEN.
  **Voice search stays FULLY AVAILABLE in the restricted flavor** (mic, Vela Voice download, the
  Search section in Settings) - it is not a content restriction, it is how a keypad user types.

How the lock works (keep this shape for any new restriction):
- `BuildConfig.RESTRICTED` (false in defaultConfig, true only in the `restricted` flavor) surfaces
  as `ui/Restricted.kt`'s `RESTRICTED_BUILD` compile-time constant.
- **The lock lives in each HOLDER, not in the Settings UI**: `init()` forces the locked value and
  never reads the pref; `set()` is a no-op. So every caller is bound, R8 strips the dead branch
  per flavor, and no pref surgery can unlock it.
- Settings hides the now-inert rows behind `if (!RESTRICTED_BUILD)`.
- The restricted flavor has its OWN applicationId (`app.vela.restricted`, debug
  `app.vela.restricted.debug`) - installs side by side, and the OS installer can never cross-grade
  a restricted install onto a standard APK. `SelfUpdater` picks the release asset matching its own
  flavor by the `restricted` name marker - keep "restricted" in the release asset filename.
- CI (`ci.yml`): debug builds are STANDARD-ONLY (`assembleStandardDebug`); release builds BOTH
  flavors and publishes `vela-maps-v<ver>.apk` + `vela-maps-v<ver>-restricted.apk` on every release.
- **A new user-facing restriction = a holder locked by `RESTRICTED_BUILD` + a hidden Settings row +
  (if it must act inside `:core`) the `CategoryFilter.enabled`-style flag pattern.** Never a fork of
  app logic per flavor and never a branch-only patch.
- **Testing: the restricted flavor obeys every D-pad + small-screen hard rule** - run the coverage
  phases against `app.vela.restricted.debug` (`VELA_PKG=app.vela.restricted.debug`) at EVERY target
  geometry. EVERY phase must pass, the `voice` phase included (the mic works in restricted too).

Branch rules:
- **Keep `feat/restrictions` synced with `main` at all times.** After anything merges to main,
  merge main into `feat/restrictions` (or rebase it) promptly - it must never drift stale.
- **On conflict, `feat/restrictions` WINS.** If a restrictions-based feature in that branch
  conflicts with something from main, resolve the conflict in favor of the restrictions branch's
  behavior - main's version yields inside that branch. Main itself is never changed by this rule;
  it only governs how conflicts are resolved WITHIN `feat/restrictions`.

## Porting from upstream (hard rules)

This is a fork of PimpinPumpkin/Vela and periodically ports fixes from it. Two
non-negotiable rules for any ported commit:

- **CREDIT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR, CLEARLY, IN THE COMMIT.** Name the upstream commit SHA in
  the commit subject or body (e.g. `Port upstream 84ab10f: ...`). Never present upstream
  work as original. The upstream project is the source; say so plainly.
- **Re-verify D-pad AND small-screen compatibility after EVERY port, thoroughly.** D-pad /
  feature-phone operability is this fork's reason to exist and upstream does not test for
  it, so a port can silently regress it. After each ported change: compile, run
  `tests/dpad/audit_static.sh` (host-side) and the `tests/dead_code` gate, and - for anything
  touching UI - the on-device `tests/dpad/run_all.sh` + `tests/dpad/audit_dynamic.sh` and
  `tests/small_screen/run_all.sh`. Those scripts are the START, not the proof: then VERIFY
  VISUALLY with screenshots per the "Visual verification" rule above - drive the ported
  surface by hand and look at it. A port that regresses D-pad or small-screen operability
  does not land.

## MapLibre gotchas (hard-won 2026-07-13, do not relearn)

- **An 8-digit hex string is NOT transparent.** `PropertyFactory.lineColor("#00000000")` renders
  OPAQUE BLACK (MapLibre's colour parser rejects the string and falls back) - this painted black
  bars over every road once the maxspeed tiles carried features. Use the `@ColorInt` overload
  (`android.graphics.Color.*`), never an 8-digit hex string.
- **queryRenderedFeatures EXCLUDES invisible features.** `lineOpacity(0f)` (or a fully transparent
  colour) makes a layer unqueryable - the speed-limit sign silently died this way. The
  invisible-but-queryable pattern is `lineOpacity(0.004f)` (1/255 alpha: imperceptible on screen,
  still rasterized, still queryable). Applies to ANY query-only layer.
- **MapLibre's pmtiles path will NOT cold-fetch tiles clamped 2+ levels below the camera.** A layer
  whose minZoom sits far above its archive's max tile zoom (address PMTiles: tiles at z16-17, layer
  at 19) never triggers a fetch on a cold source - querySourceFeatures stays 0 forever, no log, no
  error. Resident tiles overzoom fine, which makes it look intermittent. Keep the LAYER's minZoom
  inside (or within ~1 of) the archive's native range and gate visuals with stepped `textOpacity`
  instead. First probe when a pmtiles layer draws nothing: `querySourceFeatures` (0 = tiles never
  loaded), and read the archive's real zoom range from its header (bytes 100-101).
- **A fetch gate and its render layer's minZoom must move in lockstep.** Upstream lowered the Flock
  camera FETCH to z11 for route overview but left the SymbolLayer at `setMinZoom(13.5f)` - fetched
  cameras never drew. Grep for the layer's minZoom whenever a zoom gate changes.

## Porting upstream commits (hard rule, 2026-07-13)

**Read every upstream diff critically before adapting - upstream ships bugs.** Three found in one
day: the opaque-"transparent" query layer (black roads), the unqueryable opacity-0 fix (dead speed
sign), and the half-done route-overview zoom (fetch gate lowered, render layer clamped). Porting
means: read the full diff, reason about edge cases (races, gates, parsers), verify the claim
on-device, and keep fork-specific behaviour (45 s WebView ceiling, file-sink diagnostics, fork
User-Agent) that upstream's version would regress. Never `git cherry-pick` blind.

Diff-only verdicts from the 2026-07-14 smalls batch (both were OUR fixes offered upstream in
issue #131 and then iterated there):

- **House-number cold-start gate (upstream 425ca71b + a162c3a7 vs the fork's fix):** identical
  thresholds on both sides (layer arms at z17 inside the archive's z16-17 tile range; numbers show
  from z19). Upstream's second commit moved the 50 ft gate from a stepped `textOpacity` into the
  TEXT FIELD itself (`Expression.step` -> empty string below z19, `get("number")` at 19+).
  ADOPTED upstream's mechanism: empty text means NO symbols exist in the z17-18.9 band at all,
  so the densest symbol band on the map stops doing invisible placement work per frame, and
  `onAddressLabelTap` can never resolve a label the user was never shown. Visible behaviour and
  the fork's thresholds are unchanged.
- **Flock route-overview zoom (upstream f1009cee vs the fork's fix):** same fetch gate
  (`FLOCK_MIN_ZOOM = 11.0`) and same layer `setMinZoom(11f)` on both sides - kept ours. Adopted
  the one real delta: a z11 `iconSize` stop (0.55) so a metro's worth of badges reads as dots at
  overview zoom. Upstream's follow-ups 0a8bc537 + f1ddb341 (ported) then moved the flock layer
  BELOW the ambient POIs and flipped `iconIgnorePlacement` to false, so cameras always draw but
  claim their collision box - street names dodge the badge, POIs (placed earlier) still win on top.

Satellite batch (2026-07-14 port of upstream 68570ba6..bb271d94, applied as the net final
state - upstream's own 13ac02e8 already made the layers panel a VelaMenu):

- **`VelaMenu.toggleItem` touch row carries `dpadHighlight` (fork-only line).** Upstream's touch
  branch was a bare `.clickable` Row; a hybrid touch+keypad phone can key-walk the anchored
  DropdownMenu, so the fork adds the focus ring (the static auditor flags it otherwise). D-pad
  branch is upstream's verbatim.
- **Address-overlay satellite styling merged INTO the fork's layer, not over it.** Upstream's
  47897018 makes overlay house numbers white-on-black-halo over imagery; the fork's `vela-addr-*`
  layer keeps its minZoom 17 + empty-text-below-z19 textField gate and Timber logs, with only the
  colour/halo/width picking up the `satelliteOn` branch and `satelliteOn` joining the
  LaunchedEffect keys.
- **styleKey has no `pal=` here.** Upstream's key also carries a MapColors palette the fork never
  ported; the fork's key is `"$styleUri|dark=$darkTheme|sat=$satelliteOn"`.

## Transit + speed-display rules (2026-07-14)

- **Transit category checks go through `isTransitCategory()` - NEVER bare `TRANSIT_CAT`.** The gate
  regex matches "station", which also matches "Gas station" / "Charging station" / "Fire station" -
  a fuel stop next to a bus stop fetched and showed that stop's departures until the exclusion
  regex (`NON_TRANSIT_CAT`) landed. Both keyword tables are remote-overridable via the calibration
  bundle (`transitCategoryWords` / `transitExcludeWords`); compiled fallbacks carry the behaviour
  when the bundle lacks them. Any NEW transit-category test must call the one predicate.
- **Open departure boards auto-refresh every ~30 s**, on TWO loops matched to their cost:
  `startTransitousBoardRefresh` re-queries the open Transitous feed (one small JSON call, place-ID
  gated - Transitous boards can hang off id-only placeholders with no feature id), and
  `startBoardRefresh` re-loads the Google fallback board - the hidden WebView with a 45 s ceiling,
  so that loop stays SEQUENTIAL delay-then-fetch, deliberately (a slow load stretches the cadence
  instead of piling requests up; feature-id gated). Both cancel when the selection changes. Keep
  any new board source on the loop shape matching its fetch cost.
- **Speed display = TWO separate stacked cards (user design, 2026-07-14):** the regulatory SPEED
  LIMIT sign is a free-standing card ABOVE its own speedometer card; no limit -> the speedo stands
  alone. Not one shared box, not upstream's side-by-side row (squat on narrow screens - a
  deliberate fork divergence from b5f54ad0's layout). Keep it this way through rebases.

## Transitous (open GTFS transit data - primary board/timeline source, 2026-07-13 wave)

- **What it is:** [Transitous](https://transitous.org) is the community-run, keyless public-transit
  API over the world's open GTFS + GTFS-Realtime feeds (a MOTIS server). It is to transit what
  FOSSGIS OSRM is to road routing and Overpass is to POI landmarks: canonical agency data, no
  account, no key, FAIR-USE community hosting. Vela's usage stays light by design - one small JSON
  call per opened stop plus the 30 s refresh while a sheet is open, and one area-cached `map/stops`
  box per browsed viewport; the client sends an identifying User-Agent per the Transitous policy.
  The endpoint is the `Transitous.BASE` const in `core/data/transit/Transitous.kt` (NOT calibration
  - a self-hosted MOTIS is a drop-in swap if the fork ever outgrows fair use).
- **Primary-then-fallback contract (hard rule):** departure boards and stop timelines try Transitous
  FIRST; the hidden-WebView Google scrape is the FALLBACK where the open feeds lack the agency.
  Concretely: `fetchStopDepartures` does one proximity `board()` lookup at the place's own
  coordinate (no name correlation at all) and only on an empty result falls to `fetchBoardFrom` /
  `resolveIntersectionStopBoard`; `openRouteDetail` reads the tapped departure's GTFS `tripId`
  (Transitous boards stamp one on every departure; Google boards never do) and falls to the
  headsign-geocode `itineraryStep` reuse. Transit DIRECTIONS (origin-to-destination itineraries)
  still come from Google on purpose - only stop boards + timelines moved.
- **Why boards got better, not just freer:** unlike Google's anonymous place page, `stoptimes`
  returns EVERY route serving the stop with realtime flags and agency route colours, and querying a
  stop's PARENT station id aggregates all its child bays (verified live) - a multi-bay transit
  center gets one complete merged board for free. `/trip` gives the timeline per-stop realtime vs
  timetable AND per-stop/per-run CANCELLED flags, which the Google itinerary reuse could never
  provide (that is what lights the red "Cancelled" strike-through rows).
- **Canonical GTFS stops on the map (`refreshTransitStops` + `TRANSIT_STOPS_LAYER`):** at z >= 15
  the stop icons come from Transitous `map/stops` (agencies' own positions, one icon per station -
  bays collapse onto their parent), same area-cached 350 ms-debounced contract as the
  traffic-controls layer. Tapping one opens its board DIRECTLY by stop id (`onTransitStopTap`) -
  no Google resolution, no language dependence. While the layer has coverage the basemap's OSM
  `poi_transit` class="bus" icons are filter-hidden so a stop can't draw twice on different
  corners (rail/airport stay basemap); the original filter is captured once per style load and
  restored when coverage goes. MapScreen filter-hides the SELECTED stop's badge (the red pin drops
  at the same coordinate and two stacked glyphs read as a glitch).
- **Offline floor (`app/data/TransitStopCache`):** every ONLINE `map/stops` fetch overwrites its
  area in a 24-area LRU JSON on disk, so previously browsed areas keep their stops with no signal;
  a FAILED fetch never blanks stops already drawn (null from `stopsInBox` = failure and is never
  area-cached - empty list only on a genuinely stopless box). Never-visited areas fall back to the
  OSM basemap icons.
- **Load-bearing gotchas (from upstream's comments - keep them true):** `StopDeparture.realtime`
  is "the feed live-tracks this run" (the green-dot signal), NOT "the time moved"; the timeline's
  live signal is `scheduledText != null` (kept ONLY when realtime moved the shown time - same
  contract as the itinerary parser) with signed `delayMin` colouring late (red) vs early/on-time
  (green). `buildBoard` DROPS cancelled runs from boards; the timeline SHOWS cancelled calls
  (struck through). A terminus tap boards at the trip ORIGIN (an arrivals-only view has no ride
  left). Clock text is rendered in the STOP's own timezone in the Google-board "h:mm a" format the
  countdown logic parses.
- **Stop taps in EVERY app language (issue #71 upstream):** the transit-category gate carries
  keyword stems for all fifteen app languages (Hebrew included), and when a tapped stop resolves to
  NO usable Google listing at all, the tap's basemap class (language-independent) is trusted and
  the board fetches from Transitous directly at the coordinate - Transitous-or-nothing there, since
  the Google path needs a feature id that doesn't exist. The status-word tables are also
  remote-overridable now (`statusClosedWords`/`statusOpenWords` in the calibration bundle ->
  `SearchParser.remoteClosedWords`/`remoteOpenWords`, pushed by `adoptKeywordTables`); the fork's
  shipped bundle (v13) doesn't carry any keyword lists yet, so the compiled tables rule until one
  is pushed (the TransitousTest bundle guard arms itself when they appear).

## Known issues (live)

- **Cold camera at deep zoom can miss overlay house numbers** (residual edge of the 2026-07-14
  fix). ROOT CAUSE of the earlier "numbers at no zoom" scare: the address PMTiles carry tiles ONLY
  at z16-17, and MapLibre's pmtiles path will not cold-fetch a tile clamped 2+ levels below the
  camera - so a layer minZoom of 19 meant the source never fetched on any cold path (the earlier
  "pre-existing on main" reading was wrong: main's 17.5 test frame sat just UNDER its threshold, so
  the layer was correctly invisible, not broken). The fix arms the layer at z17 (in-range = tiles
  fetch, even at opacity 0) with a stepped-opacity 50 ft gate at z19; every zoom-through path
  works. Residual: a process whose camera STARTS past ~z19 without ever dipping lower fetches
  nothing (rare - the camera restores to browse zoom). Upstream has the unfixed version (layer
  minZoom 19 -> their overlay numbers never render on any cold path).

## Build

- **Build variants (reworked).**
  - `debug` is now R8-minified AND debuggable, so it runs smooth on-device (no more map-scroll/nav
    lag) while breakpoints, Timber, StrictMode and the ANR watchdog all work; it installs side by
    side with a release build via `applicationIdSuffix ".debug"` (applicationId `app.vela.debug`,
    `versionNameSuffix "-debug"`).
  - `release` = R8 + resource-shrink.
  - `staging` = release-optimized but non-debuggable, for true frame profiling.
  - R8 running on `debug` too means slower builds but the old "always ship release" caveat is gone.
- `./gradlew :core:test` runs the pure-logic unit tests (polyline, nav engine).
- **Local diagnostics (crash/ANR/jank, all on-device, no Firebase/Crashlytics).**
  - `Timber` is a thin logging facade: a `DiagTree` forwards WARN/ERROR into an opt-in breadcrumb
    ring (`DiagLog`, 300 entries, gated on the `diag_enabled` pref, default off); a `DebugTree` logs
    to Logcat in debug builds only.
  - `CrashCatcher` is the uncaught-exception handler that writes `crash-*.txt` (header + stacktrace
    + breadcrumbs) to `filesDir/diag/crash/`, surfaced in Settings → Diagnostics with export/share.
  - `ExitInfoReader` (API 30+) harvests `ApplicationExitInfo` for ANR/native-crash/SIGNALED/
    low-memory kills into `crash-exit-*.txt` on the next launch, deduped by a `last_exit_ts` pref.
  - `AnrWatchdog` (debug-only live main-thread stall detector) writes `crash-anr-*.txt` and stands
    down during crash teardown via `CrashCatcher.crashing` so a crash does not also log a bogus ANR.
  - `StrictMode` (debug-only) catches main-thread disk/network I/O, `penaltyLog` to Logcat plus
    deduped breadcrumbs into `DiagLog` keyed by violation-type + call-site so startup pref reads
    can't flood the ring.
- **D-pad regression suite (`tests/dpad/`).** On-device, reproducible. Run after any change
  that touches focus (see `docs/dpad.md`):
  - `run_all.sh` - per-surface focus assertions (bare map → search bar, Settings/Welcome/dialog/menu
    auto-focus, Choose-on-map engages, Directions pill reachable).
  - `audit_static.sh` - EXHAUSTIVE source scan (no device): every clickable/toggleable/selectable
    has a `dpadHighlight` ring, every gesture has a key path, no bare `DropdownMenu`/`AlertDialog`,
    no `isSystemInDarkTheme`; fails on any real violation. Wire it into CI.
  - `audit_dynamic.sh` - EXHAUSTIVE on-device tour: every surface opens focused, focus is never lost
    across a full traversal, BACK exits. "Nothing escapes the auditor."
  - `ring_walk.sh <pkg> <label> <steps> <outdir> [key]` - the half `audit_static.sh` CANNOT do: it
    walks a surface on device and asserts the orange ring is actually VISIBLE at every focus stop
    (the static rule only proves a ring modifier exists in the source). Saves a frame plus the
    on-screen text for every miss, because some misses are correct - the map is a focus stop with no
    ring by design, and the first frame after opening a screen can precede auto-focus. Drive the
    surface first, then walk it; `ring_sweep.sh <pkg> <WxH> <dens> <outdir>` chains the common ones.
  - `ring_walk.sh --selftest` - the negative control, frozen. Runs the ring detector over two
    committed frames in `tests/dpad/fixtures/`: one with a ringed control, and one with NO ring but a
    map full of orange POI pins. The second is the frame that a loose "orange-ish" threshold scored as
    a pass, which is how a walk over a completely unringed map came back clean. Needs no device, takes
    a second. **Run it after touching the colour match, and wire it into CI** - it is the one check
    that fails when the checker itself breaks.
- **Dead-code gate (three engines, all in CI, `main`).** ACCURACY IS THE CONTRACT: none may flag
  anything actually needed (a false positive is a bug; a false negative is tolerated).
  - `./gradlew :core:detekt :app:detekt` - parser-level dead code detekt finds and grep CANNOT:
    unused imports (delegate-aware, so Compose `by remember` `getValue`/`setValue` imports are not
    false-flagged), unused private members, unreachable code. Scoped to dead-code rules ONLY
    (`config/detekt/detekt.yml`, `buildUponDefaultConfig = false`) on the two shipped modules; NOT a
    style/complexity linter. detekt runs without type resolution, so it needs no compile classpath.
  - `tests/dead_code/audit_deadcode.sh` - the whole-tree half (host-side python, no JDK): fails
    on any public/internal top-level declaration the ENTIRE tree (every module, .kt + .xml + .kts)
    never references, counting a name used ANYWHERE (even only in its own file) as live and skipping
    every reflection/DI/framework ENTRY POINT (`@Composable`/`@Inject`/`@Provides`/`@HiltViewModel`/
    `@AndroidEntryPoint`/`@Module`/`@Serializable`/`@Preview`/`@Test`/`@Keep`/`@JvmStatic`, the
    R8-kept `core/.../model` package, the four manifest entry classes). Also surfaces whole DEAD
    MODULES as an advisory CHECK, not a hard fail. Mirrors `audit_static.sh` in shape.
  - Android Lint `UnusedResources` (scoped via the `lint{}` block) for dead drawables/strings/layouts.
- **Auditing a real drive.**
  - A saved trip stores the navigated route too (`core/replay/TripLog` format, shared by `:app`'s
    `TripStore` writer and the `:core` reader).
  - To diff what the nav cards/voice said against the plotted route from a shared trip CSV, call
    `TripLog.audit(csv)` (→ `NavReplay.Report.summary()`) or run the on-demand harness:
    `./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*auditSharedTripLog' -DvelaTrip=<abs.csv> --rerun-tasks`
    then read the report from the test-results XML `system-out`
    (`core/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest/*.xml`).
  - The property passthrough lives in `core/build.gradle.kts` (`tasks.withType<Test>` forwards
    `velaTrip`) - without it the harness silently skips. It flags silent/missed turns, too-early
    announcements, and lying card distances.
  - **Trips are SEGMENTED**: every route the drive used (start + each reroute/faster-route swap) is
    its own `RP/RD/M` block, activated at the fix where it appears; `TripLog.parse().segments`
    carries them, audit + in-app replay are segment-aware, and replays are HERMETIC
    (`NavSession.replayMode` - no live reroute/recheck fetches, recorded swaps play back via
    `replaySetRoute`; the map view scales the puck's clocks by `replaySpeedup`).
  - Never audit/replay a multi-block trip against a single mashed route. NB replays of OLD trips play
    back the dirty fixes the old pipeline recorded (BeaconDB teleports) - judge the engine on fresh
    recordings.
- **Demo / simulate-driving mode** (Settings → Navigation, off by default, pref `demo_drive` in
  `vela_settings`).
  - Drives a planned route as a SYNTHETIC GPS trace so nav can be shown/tested **anywhere** with no
    real fix. `DemoTrace.fromRoute(polyline)` (pure `:core`) → one clean `ReplayFix`/sec, fed through
    the SAME hermetic `LocationProvider.replay` path a recorded trip uses
    (`MapViewModel.startDemoDrive`, `startNav` branches on the pref).
  - It's presented as real nav, not a replay: `MapUiState.demoDriving` hides the "Stop replay" pill
    and the normal **End** (`stopNav`) cancels the demo job (its `finally` resumes live GPS + resets
    the dot/route).
  - **Turn it OFF to navigate for real** - while on, every "Start" simulates instead of using GPS.
- **Simulate-my-location (demo)** (`ui/SimLocation.kt`, Settings → Navigation, off by default,
  pref `sim_location` in `vela_settings`).
  - A sibling of demo-drive for demos/screenshots: when on, Vela pretends to be at the map centre
    (captured when you flip the toggle), so the location dot, the directions ORIGIN ("Your
    location"), and recenter all read from there instead of your real GPS.
  - Process-wide reactive holder like `TransitLayer` (`init` in `VelaApp`); `MapViewModel` applies
    it - `startLocation()` pins `myLocation` to the sim point (guard sits AFTER the replaying guard
    so demo-drive still wins), `simulateLocationHere()` captures `mapCenter`, `stopSimulateLocation()`
    resumes live GPS.
  - NB search/place-sheet DISTANCES are `near`-relative (off `mapCenter`) regardless of this toggle;
    sim-location is specifically about the dot + route origin.
  - **Turn it OFF for real navigation.**
- CI: **simple stable channel.**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: every push to `main` builds + tests, then publishes a NORMAL
    (non-prerelease) release `v0.0.<run>` (versionName `0.0.<run>`, versionCode = the GitHub run
    number, `<run>`). It builds BOTH the debug and release APKs and attaches both to the release.
  - There is no nightly/prerelease channel and no promote-to-stable workflow (both retired);
    Obtainium and the in-app updater track `releases/latest` directly.
  - **Release notes are a real changelog** built from the commit subjects since the previous
    `v0.[0-9]*` tag (the glob spans minor bumps; checkout is `fetch-depth: 0` so the tag history is
    present; the publish step formats them + a compare link into `--notes`). So **commit subjects ARE
    the user-facing changelog** - write them as plain-language changelog lines (no em-dashes, human
    voice), not terse hashes.
  - **Keep local dev builds below the current run number** (e.g. `-PappVersionCode=1`), so the
    release line always wins.
  - Release signing uses repo secrets `VELA_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `VELA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
    `VELA_KEY_ALIAS` (set; keystore at `~/.vela-signing/`, outside the repo - back it up). Without
    them the APK is debug-signed. Version override: `-PappVersionName`/`-PappVersionCode`.
  - An optional `MAPTILER_KEY` secret → `BuildConfig.MAPTILER_KEY` (`-PmaptilerKey`) switches the
    basemap to MapTiler Streets (Google-like, with a dark variant by system theme); empty locally →
    keyless OpenFreeMap. **Never commit the MapTiler key** - CI-secret + BuildConfig only.
- Toolchain: AGP 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0, Gradle
  8.11.1, compileSdk 35, minSdk 26, Java 17, Compose + Hilt + version catalog.
- Release signing from env: `VELA_KEYSTORE_PATH` / `VELA_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` /
  `VELA_KEY_ALIAS` (default alias `vela`); falls back to debug keystore locally.
- **No blocking IPC/IO from a composable body.**
  - A `PackageManager.queryIntentServices` binder IPC + per-engine `loadLabel` directly in
    composition re-runs on every recompose - jank on a Pixel, a >5 s ANR on a slow keypad phone.
  - Load such data with `produceState { withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { … } }`;
    `VoiceGuide.availableEngines()` also caches the system-engine enumeration per process.
- **Memory: the browse map runs near the heap ceiling, so keep allocation LOW (2026-07-13).**
  Panning already churns ~180 MB/12 s at baseline (ambient POI scrape + parse per pan) - pre-existing,
  close enough to the default ~256 MB heap that any EXTRA churn triggers a blocking GC per frame
  (staccato pan/zoom) and OOM-crashes on a burst. Two rules: (1) `android:largeHeap="true"` is set
  (raises the ceiling ~2x); don't remove it. (2) **Any Overpass / large-HTTP-body reader MUST
  stream-parse** - `Json.decodeFromStream(body.byteStream())` into a tiny `@Serializable` DTO, NEVER
  `resp.body.string()` + `parseToJsonElement` (that held ~5-10x the wire size in transient heap and
  OOM'd mid-read - the Flock `out body` fetch per pan did this). And NEVER lower a
  per-viewport Overpass fetch's min-zoom without shrinking the box.
  **The Overpass follow-up is DONE (audited 2026-07-20):** `OverpassAlprCameras`, `OverpassTrafficSignals`
  AND `OverpassPois` all `decodeFromStream` today. This line previously said the latter two were pending,
  which sent a low-RAM investigation chasing already-fixed code. The remaining fully-buffered hot reader
  is the GOOGLE ambient path, not Overpass: `GoogleMapsDataSource.get()` ends in `.string()`, and
  `GoogleResponse.parse` then makes a `substring` copy plus a full `JsonElement` DOM - times a 15-term
  fan-out per pan. That, not Overpass, is the ~180 MB/12 s. It cannot simply `decodeFromStream`: the
  payload is a positional nameless array walked by `at(0,1,3)` paths, so there is no DTO to decode into.
  The levers that DO move it are the term count and the `!7i` pool size.

- **Low-RAM devices are a FIRST-CLASS target, and the app now adapts to them (issue #83, 2026-07-20).**
  D-pad-first means feature-phone-first, and those phones are memory-poor as well as small.
  - **`app/ui/MemoryPressure.kt` is the one seam.** `init()` from `VelaApp` classifies the device
    (`ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice` OR heap class <= 127 MB) and `VelaApp.onTrimMemory` fans every
    `TRIM_MEMORY_*` out to registered holders. **Anything that allocates something large or NATIVE
    must register a release callback.** Registration, never a Hilt entry point: reaching a singleton
    from a trim would CONSTRUCT it, so the trim would allocate the very thing it is freeing.
  - `LowRamMode.enabled` (`:core`) is the `:core`-visible mirror, pushed in by `VelaApp` - same seam
    as `CategoryFilter.enabled`, because `:core` must never read an `:app` holder.
  - **The low-RAM predicate lives in `:core` as `LowRamMode.classify`, and it has TESTS.** It has
    shipped wrong twice, both times in ways no dev device could reveal: `heapClassMb in 1..127`
    excluded 128, the one heap class 1 GB phones and low-end 2 GB phones actually use - so the
    device issue #83 was filed from could plausibly have received none of the work - and a 0 from a
    failed probe fell out of that range and selected the memory-HUNGRY path for a device we knew
    nothing about. It now takes three signals (`isLowRamDevice`, total RAM <= 2048 MB, heap class
    <= 128 MB), **treats an unreadable probe as constrained**, and lives in `:core` purely so
    `core/src/test/.../LowRamModeTest.kt` can pin the boundaries. Failing toward low-RAM costs a
    roomy phone about a second on its first mic tap; failing the other way can OOM a phone with no
    headroom.
    - Total RAM is the signal that actually describes the device; heap class is a Dalvik knob an OEM
      can set to anything. `MemoryInfo.totalMem` reports what the OS can hand out, so a nominal 2 GB
      phone reads ~1900 MB and a 3 GB phone ~2800 MB. The M5 reads 2878 MB and stays on the normal
      path, which is what keeps every measurement in this file comparable - there is a test asserting
      exactly that, so if it ever flips you will be told.
  - **`resetprop` exercises REAL low-RAM detection, and is the ONLY way to do it on a release
    build.** `debug.vela.lowram` is `BuildConfig.DEBUG`-gated, so it is inert on `staging`/`release`
    - the low-RAM branches had therefore never run on a minified build at all.

        adb shell su -c "resetprop dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit 96m"   # then relaunch
        adb shell su -c "resetprop dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit 256m"  # restore

    `ActivityManager.staticGetMemoryClass()` reads that property per call, so the app sees the new
    heap class immediately and `LowRamMode.classify` runs for real (`forced=no`). Magisk's
    `resetprop` is what makes a `ro.`-style property writable. RESTORE IT - it changes the heap
    growth limit for every app started afterwards.
    - **Verify by BEHAVIOUR, not by log, on staging.** `Timber.plant(DebugTree)` is DEBUG-gated, so
      `MemoryPressure init` never reaches logcat on a production build. Use the renderer count
      instead: low-RAM skips the speculative WebView warm, so
      `adb shell ps -A | grep -c sandboxed_process` is 0 after a search on the low-RAM path and 1 on
      the normal one. That signal was 0/0/0 versus 1/1/1 across three pairs - perfectly separated,
      unlike PSS.
    - Measured this way on `staging`, the low-RAM path is worth about **148 MB**: 166/169/173 MB
      against 287/372/295 MB. It also proves R8 did not break those branches (0 crashes).
  - **Simulating memory pressure: the pages must stay HOT or you measure nothing.** A hog that
    allocates once is simply compressed into this device's 1.6 GB of zram, and `MemAvailable` goes
    UP - the first attempt at this "applied" 1500 MB and freed 148 MB. Re-touch every page in a loop
    to deny them to the swapper. Then it bites: `MemAvailable` fell to ~130 MB and lmkd began
    killing on "direct reclaim and thrashing".
    - **What that revealed, and it matters for the whole design: trims are not a reliable defence.**
      Under real pressure `staging` received **zero** `onTrimMemory` callbacks and was killed 20 s
      in (`oom_score_adj 0`, reason "device is not responding"); the debug build at a gentler 1.6 GB
      got **exactly one** `level=15`, released and purged in 1 ms, and was killed 8 s later. lmkd
      kills on thrash-driven unresponsiveness before AMS gets round to asking anyone to release.
      **Proactive reclaim - the idle reapers, not warming what will not be used, not holding a
      document after a scrape - is what actually protects a constrained phone.** A release that only
      happens on trim mostly does not happen.
    - Do not push past ~1.6 GB on this device. At 1.9 GB the launcher enters a kill loop and the app
      dies before `MemoryPressure.init` even runs, so the test stops discriminating between good and
      bad memory behaviour and only says "the device is broken". A continuously-rewritten 1.9 GB is
      a pathological workload, not a small phone.
  - **Verify the low-RAM path or it ships unverified.** Every dev phone we own reports
    `lowRam=false heapClassMb=256`, so those branches are dead code locally. Debug builds honour
    `adb shell setprop debug.vela.lowram true` (then relaunch). NB `false` FORCES the normal path,
    it does NOT clear the override - clearing needs an unparseable value, so use
    `setprop debug.vela.lowram none`. The two only look equivalent because every dev phone we own
    detects as normal anyway. `setprop <name> ""` is a shell syntax error, not a reset.
  - **Measuring: `am send-trim-memory` REFUSES background levels on a foreground process**
    ("Unable to set a background trim level on a foreground process"). Press HOME first. A harness
    that discards that stderr measures NOTHING and reports a clean baseline - this happened here and
    produced a whole benchmark of void numbers before the error was noticed. Always check it.
  - Measured on an M5 (2.9 GB, Android 13, standardDebug, median of 5 cold starts) main vs the fix,
    low-RAM path: peak PSS 831 MB -> 581 MB (-30%), post-trim 397 MB -> 246 MB (-38%), native heap
    223 MB -> 95 MB (-57%), cold start 4811 ms -> 4333 ms. Idle PSS run-to-run variance is +-60 MB,
    so single idle readings prove nothing; compare post-trim, which is paired within a run.
  - **The ASR model is the single largest reclaimable allocation: ~267 MB PSS** (~101 MB of weights
    in `scudo:secondary` plus ~146 MB of onnxruntime arena in `scudo:primary`). It releases on a
    severe trim, is NOT warmed at startup on a low-RAM device, and - on EVERY device - is dropped
    after `REAP_IDLE_MS` (120 s) unused and rebuilt on next use. `WhisperRecognizer.release()`
    declines while a listen is in flight - freeing the native recognizer under a running decode is a
    use-after-free that takes the process down rather than throwing.
  - **Do not reach for a device gate when an IDLE gate will do.** The warm-at-startup behaviour was
    first made low-RAM-conditional, which protected the instant-first-mic-tap UX on roomier phones
    but left them holding 267 MB all session. Reaping on idle keeps that UX AND reclaims the memory
    everywhere: device-verified on the 2.9 GB M5, `scudo:secondary` 111 MB -> 9 MB at the 120 s mark
    with the model rebuilding on next use. Idle PSS 421 MB -> 299 MB (-29%) on a NON-low-RAM device.
    Ask "can this be released when unused?" before "which devices should get less?".
  - **`MapView.onLowMemory()` must be called.** MapLibre's tile/glyph/sprite caches are native and
    that is the only way to shrink them; nothing called it before.
  - **Cutting the ambient TERM COUNT does not cut peak memory, and it silently deletes POIs.** The
    low-RAM path briefly fetched 8 of the 15 category terms. Both halves of that were wrong.
    - Peak is set by `ambientFanout`, a `Semaphore(4)`, and every buffer (response String, stripped
      copy, `JsonElement` DOM) is allocated INSIDE `withPermit`. At most 4 exist at once however many
      terms are queued behind them, so 15 -> 8 changes the number of WAVES, not the peak. The
      semaphore's own KDoc already said this: "Bounding to 4 caps the peak transient heap with the
      same final pool." The levers that DO move the peak are the permit count and the response size
      (`!7i`), and only the latter is used.
    - Its justification was false. It kept `school` and `park` on the grounds that only they lack a
      second source while the ambient layer is up. NOTHING has one then: `VelaMapView` sets
      `poi_r1/poi_r7/poi_r20` to `NONE` **wholesale** on `if (navMode || ambientPois.isNotEmpty())`,
      not per category. The dropped terms lost their fallback identically. Parks at least keep a
      landuse polygon so the green area survives without the pin; a gym, bar or pharmacy exists ONLY
      as a pin, making those the worse things to drop, not the safer ones.
    - The observation behind it was real (a 6-term subset did lose every park and school pin, caught
      by an A/B screenshot). The GENERALISATION drawn from one observation was not. When a screenshot
      shows category X vanishing, that is evidence about the fan-out, not about X being special.
  - **A Kotlin `release()` does NOT give memory back to the KERNEL, only to scudo.** Freeing a model
    or a WebView returns its pages to the allocator's free lists, where RSS/PSS still count them and
    lmkd still sees a fat process. `mallopt()` is the only way to hand them on and it is reachable
    only from C, which is why `app/src/main/cpp/velamem.cpp` exists - the app's ONLY native module,
    ~4 KB per ABI, built for `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a` only. `MemoryPressure.dispatch` schedules
    it 750 ms after every trim (the delay matters: the WebView reapers post `destroy()` to the main
    looper and `VelaApp` clears Coil after `dispatch` returns, so an inline purge would run before
    the memory it is meant to reclaim was actually freed).
    - Measured on the M5, 3 alternating A/B pairs, ASR-model-release scenario: with the purge
      suppressed `scudo:primary` moved 60/32/28 KB in the 7 s after a severe trim, i.e. NOTHING;
      with it on, 3704/3008/2792 KB. No overlap. A second 8-pair A/B over map/POI churn showed the
      same shape, 3345 KB -> 6931 KB mean reclaimed (Mann-Whitney U=7, n=8/8, p<0.05).
    - Do NOT expect this to reclaim the onnxruntime arena. It is worth a consistent ~3 MB, not tens.
      The ASR model's ~111 MB lives in `scudo:secondary`, which is mmap-backed and comes back on
      `free()` with no purge needed - measured 111 MB -> 7 MB in BOTH arms. The purge only moves
      `scudo:primary`, which stays around 75 MB either way.
    - `M_PURGE_ALL` is API 34+. On the Android 13 dev phone it returns 0 and the code falls back to
      `M_PURGE` (API 28+). The logged `mode=` says which actually took (2, 1, or 0 for neither);
      do not assume `M_PURGE_ALL` ran just because `all=true` was passed.
  - **Backgrounding delivers `TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN` (20), NOT `TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND` (40).**
    Measured on the M5: pressing HOME logs `dispatch level=20` and nothing more; 40 arrives only
    later, once the process sinks in the LRU list under real pressure. `isSevere` starts at 40, so
    it is deliberately FALSE at the single most common moment the app is handed. That is right for
    releasing (do not thrash a model on every HOME press) and wrong for purging, which is why the
    purge triggers from `TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW` (10) up. Anything that should happen "when the
    user leaves the app" must key off 20, not 40.
  - **A/B a memory change on ONE binary or the arms differ in more than the change.** Two builds
    also differ in background settling, and idle PSS swings +-60 MB run to run, so a cross-build
    comparison cannot attribute a few MB to anything. `adb shell setprop debug.vela.nopurge true`
    suppresses the purge at runtime, which makes the delta a paired within-run measurement. Verify
    the gate really gates before trusting either arm: one arm must log `native purge suppressed`
    and the other `native purge all=... mode=...`, or the A/B is measuring one thing twice.
  - **The hidden WebViews are the single largest thing Vela costs, and app PSS CANNOT SEE IT.**
    Android runs the WebView renderer OUT OF PROCESS. Measured on the M5 after one search:
    `sandboxed_process0` at 305-347 MB PSS, plus `webview_service` 21 MB and `webview_apk` 37 MB,
    none of it in the app's own `dumpsys meminfo`. Every issue-#83 number was app-PSS only, so the
    largest item in the app was invisible to the whole exercise. **When measuring memory here,
    always `adb shell ps -A | grep sandboxed_process` and total the WebView processes too.**
    - The app-side half is `GL mtrack`, and it is huge: 26 MB with no WebView alive, 396-461 MB once
      the two scraper WebViews exist. That is the offscreen layouts (`WV_WIDTH`x`WV_HEIGHT`, e.g.
      1200x3200) allocating graphics buffers charged to OUR process. Chromium logs
      `tile memory limits exceeded` at that size. Cutting the offscreen viewport is a real lead.
  - **MEASURE THE `staging` VARIANT, NOT `debug`.** `staging` is `initWith(release)` - R8-minified,
    resources shrunk, non-debuggable, installs side by side as `app.vela.staging` - so it is the
    production memory profile without touching a real release install. Every number in issue #83 was
    `standardDebug` and overstates the app substantially:

    | state | standardDebug | standardStaging (production) |
    |---|---|---|
    | after a search (warm) | ~460 MB | **~279 MB** |
    | place open | 410-508 MB | **335-392 MB** |
    | after a severe trim | - | **140-146 MB** |
    | `Code` bucket | 101 MB | **30-45 MB** |

    The `Code` gap is extracted dex and JIT profiles that simply do not exist in a release build, so
    roughly 55-70 MB of any debug reading is an artifact. Check a conclusion against `staging` before
    spending effort on it.
  - **`mallinfo` "free" is address space, NOT reclaimable resident memory. Do not chase it.** The
    arena routinely reports something like 440 MB total against 41 MB live, which looks like ~400 MB
    waiting to be reclaimed. It is not: scudo has already madvised those pages away, and
    `scudo:primary` PSS at that same moment was only 67 MB. Measured directly by purging during
    active use with no listener release (a `RUNNING_MODERATE` trim, which `isSevere` excludes):
    `scudo:primary` moved 67.1 -> 64.5 MB, i.e. **2.6 MB**. A periodic idle purge is therefore not
    worth building; the earlier framing of that gap as reclaimable was wrong.
  - **What the `mallopt` purge is actually worth: ~10 MB, on production.** A/B on `staging`, 3 runs
    per arm, comparing where `scudo:primary` SETTLES after a severe trim (the pre-trim value swings
    147-382 MB run to run and is useless): purge on 52.4/53.1/54.1 MB, purge off 54.4/58.6/76.7 MB.
    A single trim reclaims 133-328 MB on production, but nearly all of that is the registered
    listeners releasing plus what the platform already does on trim - only ~10 MB is the purge. Do
    not credit the purge with the whole trim delta; run the control.
  - **Throw the scraped DOCUMENT away when the scrape ends; the viewport is not the lever.** After
    a scrape the photo fetcher used to hold a fully rasterized Google Maps page until the 120 s reap,
    i.e. through the whole time the user reads the place sheet. `blankAfterScrape()` navigates to
    `about:blank` in `fetch()`'s `finally`. Measured at place-open + 75 s: **`GL mtrack` ~497 MB ->
    64-70 MB and TOTAL PSS ~950 MB -> 410-508 MB**, photo counts unchanged.
    - Resizing does NOT work, and this was measured before believing it: shrinking the view to 0x0
      after a scrape reclaimed nothing at all (494/496/497 MB against a 497/498 MB control). Chromium
      keeps the tiles it has rasterized for a live document regardless of view size. **Document
      lifetime is the only lever with leverage here** - the 1200x3200 viewport is 3.84 Mpx = 15 MB at
      4 B/px, yet GL mtrack was ~490 MB, so the number is a whole composited layer tree against a
      tile budget, not one viewport buffer. Stop spending device time on geometry.
  - **`about:blank` opens the next fetch's load gate early unless you guard for it.** Parking the
    view at `about:blank` broke the NEXT scrape: its `onPageFinished` fires on the freshly installed
    `webViewClient`, completes the `ready` gate before the real page commits, and the scraper injects
    into an empty document. **Caught only by opening a SECOND place** - the same place scraped 33
    photos as the first place opened and 0 as the second. `onPageFinished` now ignores `about:` URLs.
    - Test the second place, every time. A one-place test cannot see any bug in WebView REUSE, and
      re-tapping the SAME place is served from the LRU cache without scraping at all, so it cannot
      see one either. Confirm from the log that two DIFFERENT featureIds actually scraped.
  - **Do not LAY OUT a scraper WebView until it is actually scraping.** `WebPhotoFetcher` sized its
    view inside `ensureWebView`, i.e. at construction, and `warm()` goes through `ensureWebView` - so
    a speculative warm built a full 1200x3200 composited surface over `maps?hl=en`, a page with zero
    scrapeable content, and held it for the entire 300 s warm window on a 480x640 phone. Sizing moved
    into `sizeForScrape(wv)`, called immediately before `loadUrl` in `fetch()`. Matched A/B, same
    harness, 3 runs per arm, search-then-browse with no place opened:
    **`GL mtrack` 448/427/441 MB -> 77/71/72 MB (-365 MB) and TOTAL PSS 866/854/852 MB ->
    485/460/459 MB (-390 MB)**, with the scrape byte-for-byte unaffected (28/28/28 photos on the
    same place in both arms).
    - This fetcher is the ONLY one that lays out during a warm. `WebPopularTimesFetcher.prewarm`,
      `WebDirectionsFetcher` and `WebStopDeparturesFetcher` never call measure/layout at all, and
      `WebReviewsFetcher` has no warm. That is why every GL number in this codebase tracks THIS view,
      and why a reviews-side change looked like it helped when it could not have.
    - The size itself is load-bearing at scrape time - the grids virtualize, so at 0x0 a category tab
      renders about one tile and the scrape comes back nearly empty. Size BEFORE `loadUrl` so the
      page's first layout is already at scrape geometry. Deferring the layout is safe precisely
      because it leaves scrape-time geometry identical; SHRINKING it is not the same bet.
    - Gate any viewport change on scrape COUNT, not memory. Both fetchers log
      `scraped N photos/reviews for <featureId>` for exactly this. A change that halves memory and
      quietly halves the gallery is a regression no memory metric shows.
    - **A quality metric stuck at zero cannot fail, so it proves nothing.** A 720 px width was tried
      and reverted: on the photo side it held (28 -> 28) but on the reviews side the scrape returns 0
      for every place tried at 1200 AND at 720 - a pre-existing failure - so that arm was
      unfalsifiable. Check the control can produce a non-zero result before trusting an A/B.
    - `GL mtrack` at place-open is BIMODAL (~490 MB laid out and alive, ~71 MB not), so single
      readings there mean nothing. Measure the warm window, repeat, and report the spread.
  - **BOTH speculative warms have to be bounded or neither helps.** The renderer is SHARED by every
    WebView in the process, so one un-reaped view keeps it alive for all of them. `WebPhotoFetcher`
    had no idle reaper at all, and `WebPopularTimesFetcher.prewarm()` created a view and never
    called `scheduleReap()` (only `fetch()` did). `MapViewModel` warms both on every search, so one
    search pinned the renderer for the session. Device-verified the hard way: reaping only the photo
    view left the renderer alive at ~200 MB because the popular-times view still held it. Fixing
    both, with no trim involved, took the renderer to zero and app PSS 744 MB -> 351 MB.
    - A speculative warm gets a LONGER reap window than a real fetch (`WARM_REAP_IDLE_MS` 300 s vs
      `REAP_IDLE_MS` 120 s). The warm exists so the first place tap skips the cold start; reaping it
      at 120 s would expire during an ordinary browse and waste the warm entirely. Bounded, not
      short, is the goal - the bug was session-long, not "not aggressive enough".
  - **A reap must drain `pending`, exactly like `rendererGone` does.** Destroying the view kills the
    injected scraper, so nothing will ever complete those deferreds; a reap landing mid-fetch parks
    the fetch in `deferred.await()` for the full `TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS` (40 s) while it HOLDS the
    fetcher's `Mutex`, stalling everything queued behind it. An empty result is the documented
    best-effort failure; a 40 s hang is not.
  - **Verifying a reap needs a LOG, not a process check.** `WebView.destroy()` does not kill the
    renderer promptly - measured 220 MB still resident 8 s after a destroy and the process gone only
    minutes later - and an OS trim can kill it for unrelated reasons, so "the process went away" does
    not mean your timer fired. The first attempt to verify this was unfalsifiable for exactly that
    reason: the renderer vanished at t+60 s and the logs showed `dispatch level=15`/`40`, i.e. a real
    trim, not the reaper. Log the reap, then assert the log AND assert no severe trim fired.
  - **Freeing a native model needs a LEASE, not an atomic counter checked outside the lock.**
    `WhisperRecognizer` guards the recognizer with `leases`, mutated ONLY under `loadLock`, and
    `release()` checks the count and frees inside that same lock. The first version of this checked
    an `AtomicInteger` before taking the lock while `ensureRecognizer()` handed the pointer out on a
    lock-free fast path, which is a check-then-act: the reaper reads 0, a mic tap increments and
    takes the pointer, the reaper frees it under the running decode. `runCatching` around the decode
    CANNOT save you - `OfflineRecognizer.release()` frees C++ memory and the result is a SIGSEGV in
    `libsherpa-onnx-jni` that takes the process down. **An atomic counter does not make a
    check-then-act atomic.** Take the lease and the pointer under one lock, or do not take either.
  - **`release()` must not block the main thread, so it `tryLock`s.** It is called from
    `onTrimMemory` on the main thread, and `loadLock` is held across the ~1 s native model load, so
    a blocking acquire stalls the UI thread for that whole load just to reclaim memory the idle
    reaper would reclaim anyway. Skipping is safe; the next trim or the reaper retries. `Remove
    model` passes `wait = true` because there the user asked for it. Device-verified that this
    window is REAL and not theoretical: hammering `am send-trim-memory <pid> RUNNING_CRITICAL`
    across startup logged `release skipped, model load in progress` 5 times in one run.
    - `RUNNING_CRITICAL` is the level to use for this - it is `isSevere` AND the OS accepts it on a
      FOREGROUND process, so it exercises the load window without needing HOME first.
  - **A quarantined ASR model makes `warmUp()` a silent no-op.** `WhisperRecognizer.isInstalled()`
    is `AsrModel.isInstalled() && !asr_model_bad`, and the corrupt-model quarantine (`asr_model_bad`
    in `vela_settings`) is only ever lifted by the installer's `clearQuarantine()`. Side-loading the
    model files by hand leaves the flag set, so the model never loads, `scudo:secondary` sits at
    ~11 MB instead of ~111 MB, and a memory benchmark silently measures the model-absent case. Check
    `secondary` is actually ~111 MB before believing any ASR memory number.

## Performance: what has been measured

- **The slowness users feel is CONTENT LATENCY, not frames. Measure that axis first.**
  Device-measured on staging: **tapping a place to a complete gallery is 28.8 s** (35 photos). The
  scrapers are built around 40 s and 45 s timeouts with a 7 s page-load allowance, and the photo
  scraper's own JS polls up to 58 ticks at 500 ms, so ~30 s is the designed shape, not a stall.
  Frame time on the same device is 9.0 ms against a 16.7 ms budget - there is nothing to win there.
  A user reporting "the whole app is a bit slow" is far more likely describing this than jank.
  - So performance work on Vela should start with: how long until the user sees the thing they asked
    for? Search results, ambient POI pins, the gallery, reviews. Not `gfxinfo`, not cold start.
  - A concrete lead nobody has pulled: `GoogleMapsDataSource.nearbyPlaces` fans out 15 category
    terms 4-at-a-time and finishes with `awaitAll().flatten()`, so **every ambient pin appears at
    once after the slowest term**, roughly four network waves in. Streaming each term's results as
    they land would put first pins on screen ~4x sooner for the same total work. That is a real
    user-visible latency change though, so it needs a before/after and a careful look, not a
    drive-by edit.
- **The UI is NOT the bottleneck - measure before optimising it.** An atrace across cold start plus
  a D-pad drive on the staging build: `Choreographer#doFrame` totals 3,860 ms over **430 frames =
  9.0 ms per frame**, against a 16.7 ms budget at 60 Hz. measure/layout/draw is 3.5 ms/frame and
  inflate is 16 ms in total. **There is no frame-budget problem on this device.** GC, at 2,165 ms,
  is the largest remaining cost, which is why allocation work (see the `FlockCameras` index) is the
  productive direction and composable restructuring is not.
  - This measurement should have come FIRST. Two `MapScreen` extractions were attempted and reverted
    before anyone checked whether the uncompiled composable was actually costing frames. It is not.
    A method being uncompiled only matters if it runs hot, and at 9 ms/frame this one does not hurt.
- **`MapScreen` is too big for ART to COMPILE, so the main screen runs interpreted.** On the
  shipping build ART logs `Method exceeds compiler instruction limit: 19621 in void
  i2.r1.f(i2.E3, z3.a, Z.p, int)`, which the R8 mapping resolves to
  `MapScreenKt.MapScreen(MapViewModel, Function0, Composer, int)` (`MapScreenKt -> i2.r1`,
  `MapScreen -> f`). ART's optimizing compiler skips methods over ~10,000 dex instructions, so the
  composable that runs on every recomposition of the main screen is never compiled. Verify with:

      adb logcat -d | grep -i "exceeds compiler instruction limit"

  The body spans roughly lines 192-2172 of a 3,479-line file. It is the largest known code-size
  anomaly, but per the frame measurement above it is **not** a demonstrated performance problem -
  do not spend effort here without first showing it costs frames.
  - The fix is to extract the big `if` blocks under the root `Box` into private composables. A
    trial extraction of the largest (lines 1828-2048, the idle-map overlay block, 221 lines) was
    done and reverted, and it establishes the recipe: the function needs a **`BoxScope` receiver**
    (the block uses `Modifier.align`), and it captures **23** names - `chromeLift, context,
    darkTheme, driveFollowing, followMe, layersOpen, metersPerPixel, parkedCarLabel,
    parkingClearedMsg, parkingMovedMsg, parkingNoFixMsg, parkingSet, parkingTapAction, resultsShown,
    searchOpen, show, showParkingHistory, showParkingMenu, softkeyBarShown, speedOverlayArmed,
    state, vm`.
  - Six of those are `var ... by remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` (`followMe`, `layersOpen`,
    `metersPerPixel`, `showParkingHistory`, `showParkingMenu`, `speedOverlayArmed`) and the block
    WRITES them. Pass the `MutableState<T>` and re-delegate at the top of the extracted function
    (`var showParkingMenu by showParkingMenuState`) so the 221-line body stays byte-identical.
    Passing them by value is a compile error, not a silent break - the compiler is the safety net
    here, which is what makes this refactor tractable.
  - Do it ONE block at a time, rebuilding and re-checking the logcat number after each, and stop
    when the message disappears. Screenshot the map after each step.
  - **EXTRACTION DOES NOT WORK. Two controlled experiments, both worse. Do not try a third.**
    Extracting a block into a private composable consistently INCREASES MapScreen's instruction
    count, and the effect is not explained by how many values the block captures:

    | block extracted | lines | captures | lines/capture | MapScreen after |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | (baseline) | - | - | - | **19,621** |
    | 1828-2048 idle overlays | 221 | 23 | 9.6 | 20,351 (+730) |
    | 991-1104 dpad overlay | 114 | 9 | 12.7 | **21,638 (+2,017)** |

    The second was chosen precisely because it had a far better lines-per-capture ratio, on the
    theory that Compose's per-parameter `$changed` plumbing was the cost. It came out WORSE than the
    first. Both compiled, installed and ran without crashing, so this is a code-size result, not a
    correctness one; both were reverted. Whatever dominates the count, adding a composable call
    layer costs more than the body it removes. **Shrinking MapScreen under the ~10,000 limit is not
    reachable by pulling blocks out of it**, and anyone trying should have a different hypothesis
    and measure it in one build before doing the work.
  - The stale earlier advice below is kept only for the mechanics it records (BoxScope receiver,
    passing `MutableState` and re-delegating with `by` so the body stays byte-identical). Those
    techniques are correct; the strategy they serve is not.
  - **A naive extraction makes it WORSE, and this was measured, not guessed.** The 221-line block
    above was fully extracted into `BoxScope.MapIdleOverlays` with all 21 captures passed and the
    six `MutableState`s re-delegated. It compiled, ran and did not crash - and MapScreen went
    **19,621 -> 20,351 instructions**. Compose emits `$changed`/`$changed1` bitmask plumbing per
    parameter at the call site, and for a capture set that size it costs more than the body removes.
    The change was reverted.
  - So the rule is: **extract blocks with FEW captures, not the biggest blocks.** Before extracting,
    count the captures (comment out the block, compile, read the unresolved references - that is
    the exact list, and it takes one build). A 100-line block taking 4 parameters will beat a
    220-line block taking 21. Recomputing composable-local values inside the extracted function
    (`LocalContext.current`, `stringResource`, `isAppInDarkTheme()`, `VelaSoftkeys.isActive()`)
    rather than passing them also drops the count without changing behaviour.
- **Startup is GC-bound, not compilation-bound. Do not reach for a baseline profile.** Forcing full
  AOT (`cmd package compile -m speed -f`) made cold start WORSE - 828 ms against 775 ms - which is
  an upper bound on anything a profile could buy. An atrace of a cold start instead attributes
  seconds to GC (`CopyingPhase`, `NativeAlloc concurrent copying GC`, `MarkingPhase`), so allocation
  count at startup is the thing worth cutting. That is what motivated the `FlockCameras` CSR index.
- **Measuring startup: control the dexopt state or measure nothing.** `adb install -r` resets it, so
  runs straight after an install are unprofiled and slower. Comparing a fresh-install arm against a
  warmed baseline once "showed" that REMOVING work made startup slower. Cold start on this device
  swings 739-1552 ms even matched, so prefer a lower-variance metric (atrace GC slices) for anything
  smaller than a few hundred ms.
- **`dumpsys gfxinfo` does not measure this app's map.** MapLibre renders through its own GL context,
  so HWUI frame stats cover only the Compose chrome - a D-pad drive produced 60 frames at 0% jank
  and a swipe drive 11 frames, neither of which could have detected a regression.

## Layout

- `:core` is the UI-agnostic "extractor" (NewPipeExtractor pattern). `:app` is
  the Compose UI. Don't let MapLibre or Android UI types leak into `:core`
  (convert `LatLng` at the view boundary).
- **`:yapchik` is a vendored third-party library** (source-identical copy of
  github.com/theOnionsAreWatching/yapchik, LGPL-3.0, package `com.theonionsarewatching.yapchik`,
  own LICENSE + NOTICE). The hardware LEFT/RIGHT soft-key bar for keypad phones. Kept as its own
  module so it stays cleanly REPLACEABLE - re-sync from upstream by recopying, don't hand-edit its
  files. It is NOT under detekt (Vela's dead-code gate would false-positive its public API). Vela's
  integration lives in `app/ui/softkey/VelaSoftkeys.kt` (install + gate + the `Key`/`MapSoftkeys`
  seam); `MapScreen` picks the two keys CONTEXTUALLY from a `when` (bare map = Options / Search, place
  sheet = Options / Directions, choose-on-map = Cancel / Set, route preview = Steps / Start,
  turn-by-turn = Options / Zoom-mode, search overlay = none). The bare-map Options menu has ONE
  ADAPTIVE map-motion item that nests: Move map (idle) -> Zoom (once moving) -> Stop zoom (while
  zooming); BACK peels one mode at a time (zoom -> move-map -> bare map), owned by the single map
  BackHandler. Each Options popup is a feature-phone `VelaMenu(placement = BottomStart)` (bordered,
  flush on the bar). The whole design is `docs/softkeys.md`. Key mechanisms to reuse, not reinvent:
  **`SuppressBarWhile`** forces the bar off for a whole screen (Settings over the map);
  **`SuppressBarForModal`** (a reactive `modalDepth` any `VelaDialog` bumps) hides it while a modal is
  up - a `VelaMenu` is NOT a modal, so it keeps the bar; theme-following is a REBUILD but ONLY on an
  actual theme flip (an unconditional rebuild churned the bar + flashed the system bar every screen
  switch); `navGuardDp = 0` kills Yapchik's phantom nav-guard height (Vela's FRAMEWORK window theme
  would otherwise double the bar's height on a device with no real nav bar). Labels are localized (all
  14 locales). The `softkey` phase in `full_coverage.sh` (+ `K_SOFT_LEFT`/`K_SOFT_RIGHT` in
  `tests/dpad/lib.sh`) captures the menus. **Softkeys gate on
  `isDpadFirstDevice` (same detector as the Compose D-pad affordances) so they NEVER show on touch** -
  keep any new binding on that gate, through `Softkeys.of(activity)` / `VelaSoftkeys`, not a fork of
  the engine. When a soft key covers an action, DROP the redundant on-screen button on keypad (gated
  on `VelaSoftkeys.isActive()`), the way the map's +/-, the place sheet's whole button row, and - tester
  #76 - the bare-map **search bar** (the RIGHT soft key opens it), the **Layers** button and the **Park**
  FAB are; Layers + Park move into the Options menu (now Move-map/Zoom / Recenter / Layers / Park /
  Settings), Park's hub + history hoisted out of the hidden FAB, and with the search bar gone the
  category chips ride up into its freed slot. The bare-map update card's actions ride the bar too
  (Not now / Update). **Harness:** `full_coverage.sh` + `nav.sh` branch on `softkeys_shown()` (the
  `vela_force_dpad` gate) - search/settings/voice/park enter via the soft keys under D-pad and via the
  on-screen bar/gear/FAB otherwise (`open_search`, `park_action`, conditional `run_coffee`/
  `open_settings`) - so a non-forced (touch) run is never broken.
    **HARD RULE - WHEN YOU GATE A CONTROL OFF, HOIST WHAT IT OPENS OUT FIRST.** Compose composes a
  tree: anything nested INSIDE a block you switch off is switched off with it, silently. Dropping an
  on-screen button therefore kills any panel/menu/sheet declared inside that button's block, and the
  menu entry that was supposed to replace it then writes state nobody reads - the feature becomes
  UNREACHABLE while every screenshot still looks right. This has now bitten twice on the same
  refactor: the **Park hub + history sheet** (caught pre-merge) and the **Layers panel** (shipped, and
  found by a tester on a Kyocera DuraXe e4830 - no button, and an Options entry that did nothing).
  Both are fixed by hoisting the panel to a sibling of the gated button, keeping its own `TopEnd`/
  `BottomEnd` box so the touch dropdown still anchors where the button sits, and leaving it inert
  while closed. **Before gating any on-screen control, grep what is declared inside its block.**
  It came within one edit of a third time (2026-07-19): hiding the **locate FAB** meant adding
  `!softkeyBarShown` to the enclosing block - and the parking hub menu + history sheet are hoisted
  *inside that very block*, so gating it would have taken Options -> Park down exactly like Layers.
  The gate went on the FAB alone. When the thing you want to hide shares a block with a hoisted
  panel, **gate the control, never the block.**

    **HARD RULE - NEVER TEST `screenHeightDp`/`screenWidthDp` TO ASK "IS THIS A SMALL SCREEN".**
  `AdaptiveDensity.wrap` shrinks a narrow screen's density at `attachBaseContext` and then INFLATES
  the reported dp size to match (that is the point - more dp of room), so after wrapping every small
  device reports exactly `MIN_WIDTH_DP` (360) wide and a PROPORTIONALLY TALLER height. A Sonim x320 is
  physically 427dp tall and reports **640dp**. Any `screenHeightDp < N` smallness test therefore reads
  FALSE on the very phones it was written for, and fails SILENTLY - the layout just stays in its roomy
  variant and nothing looks broken enough to notice. The nav banner's compact mode was dead this way
  from the day AdaptiveDensity landed until 2026-07-19, on our primary target device. Use
  **`AdaptiveDensity.applied`**, which is true exactly when the raw screen is narrower than 360dp.
  Keep a height test only as an OR for a screen that is short but wide enough that AdaptiveDensity
  left it alone. When you add any size-conditional layout, verify it on the device and confirm the
  branch you intended is the branch that renders.

    **HARD RULE - NEVER CONCLUDE "IT IS UNFOCUSED" FROM `focused()`.** `tests/dpad/lib.sh focused()`
  reads uiautomator's `focused="true"`, and a Compose node can hold focus - with a plainly visible ring
  - while it returns EMPTY (reproduced on main's search bar, 2026-07-20). Hours were lost to
  conclusions drawn from it, and one wrong claim reached a PR description. **Screenshot the surface and
  look for the ring.** The same caution applies to `audit_dynamic.sh`'s focus assertions, which are
  built on it; its reachability checks (text matching) are sound.

    **HARD RULE - A/B AGAINST `main`, NOT AGAINST A COMMIT INSIDE YOUR OWN BRANCH.** To answer "did we
  introduce this?", build `origin/main` (or the branch point) - not the commit before today's work. A
  baseline 40 commits deep in the same PR can only ever answer "did the LAST change break it", and
  reporting that as "pre-existing" is wrong in the way that matters: it says *not ours*. Checking
  whether the symbol even exists on main (`git show origin/main:<file> | grep`) is one command and
  settles it before you say anything.

    **HARD RULE - THE FOCUS RING HUGS THE CONTROL, NOT MATERIAL'S TOUCH TARGET.** Material applies
  `minimumInteractiveComponentSize()` INSIDE buttons and chips, padding their layout to the 48dp
  minimum touch target while the visible surface stays 40dp (button) or 32dp (chip). A `dpadHighlight`
  on the control's own modifier sits OUTSIDE that padding, so it measures the inflated box and draws a
  ring visibly too tall, floating clear of the control - reported as "the wrong shape" by an x320
  tester, on chips AND on the Settings update buttons. Wrap it instead: `DpadRingBox(shape)` (or the
  `VelaSwitch` pattern) rings a parent pinned to the control's REAL height; `hasFocus` propagates up
  from the focused child, which keeps its full touch target by overflowing the shorter, non-clipping
  box. And **pass the control's own shape** - the map category chips are `CircleShape` pills that were
  being ringed with an 8dp rounded rect.

    **HARD RULE - ONE FOCUS SIGNAL PER CONTROL.** `dpadHighlight(...).clickable(...)` draws Material's
  grey focus state layer AND the orange ring on the same row ("having both by the switches is a little
  strange" - tester 2026-07-19). Use `dpadClickable`, which drops the indication while input is
  key-driven and keeps the normal press ripple for touch. Likewise, a menu toggle row is ONE focus
  stop, so ring the **switch**, not the row (`dpadRingWhen` + a read-only `onCheckedChange = null`
  switch, which also stops it being a second focus stop inside a row that is already one).
- The one seam is `core/data/MapDataSource`. `MockMapDataSource` is the default
  and keeps the entire app usable offline; `google/GoogleMapsDataSource` is the
  real scraper.
- **Android Auto (`app/car/`).**
  - `VelaCarAppService` is a NAVIGATION-category templated `CarAppService` (manifest service +
    `xml/automotive_app_desc.xml` + the two `androidx.car.app.*` permissions + application-level
    `minCarApiLevel=1`); a sideload appears in the car launcher only with AA developer "Unknown
    sources" on, hence `HostValidator.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTS_VALIDATOR`.
  - `CarMapScreen` is the whole car UI: NavigationTemplate (Re-center / + / − action strip;
    RoutingInfo card with `NavSession.state.maneuverText` + distance while navigating) over a map
    surface.
  - **The MapLibre-on-car trick: SurfaceCallback surface → `DisplayManager.createVirtualDisplay` →
    `Presentation` → plain `MapView`** (MapLibre can't draw to a raw surface). It reuses
    `applyDark`/`applyLight` from VelaMapView (made `internal` for this) keyed to
    `carContext.isDarkMode`, has its OWN AOSP LocationManager listener for the puck (works with the
    phone UI closed), and draws the route from `NavSession.state.route.polyline`.
  - Pan/zoom arrive as `onScroll`/`onScale` and move the camera by hand (projection math -
    `MapLibreMap.scrollBy` isn't a thing in 11.x).
  - The PHONE runs nav (MapViewModel feeds NavSession) and speaks; the car is a display. Car-side
    search/route-start is a follow-up; untested on a real head unit yet.
- **Settings ORDER is deliberate:** Appearance → Map (traffic/transit/3D) →
  **Place pages** (ShowReviews / read-all-reviews / LoadPhotos) → Navigation (keep-screen-on,
  traffic lights, vibrate-on-turns as FilterChips one per mode, demo LAST) → Voice → Offline →
  Saved places → Data & privacy → Diagnostics → About/Support/Version(+updater). Put a new setting
  in the section it serves, not at the end; place-content settings go under Place pages, not Map.
- **Nav UI style:** ManeuverBanner + NavControls are RoundedCornerShape(24/28dp)
  Cards with elevation 6dp, 54dp turn glyph, headlineMedium-bold distance, titleMedium-medium road
  name, FilledTonalIconButton for mute/steps. On screens under 500dp tall the banner runs COMPACT (36dp glyph, titleLarge distance, tighter padding - issue #41; every text line is maxLines-capped so a long arrive card can never bury the map). Keep new nav chrome on this treatment (no flat
  default-radius cards, no OutlinedIconButton circles - that was the "dated" look).
- **In-nav search along route (ported upstream cead2dc5):** the NavControls magnifier arms
  `NavSearchChips` (Gas/Food/Coffee/Groceries, `NavOverlays.kt`) above the bar; a pick runs the
  normal `searchAlongRoute` (which skips stashing `alongRouteDest` while navigating), the nav
  branch of MapScreen's bottom `when` steps aside while `state.results` is non-empty so the
  results sheet shows, and `selectPlace` gates on `navigating` -> `addStopDuringNav` ->
  `NavSession.addStop` (user-ordered replan: the pick becomes the NEXT stop, marks null until the
  new route lands so a failed fetch keeps the stop for the next reroute/recheck; no back-on-course
  discard, no cooldown). BACK order: results list, then the chip row, then end-nav - browsing gas
  stations must never end the drive. Fork adaptations: the magnifier button matches the fork bar's
  default-size FilledTonalIconButtons (upstream's 54dp driving-target sizing is not in this fork),
  the `selectPlace` gate is merged with the a17eded6 inert-map-taps guard (a tap with no results
  list open stays inert), and under D-pad the chip row auto-focuses its first chip on arm
  (`rememberDpadAutoFocus`, beyond upstream).
  is open the search bar swaps for a Google-style endpoints card (origin ring / stops / red
  destination pin down a glyph rail, back arrow left, swap right, an Add stop row when no stops
  exist); `DirectionsPanel` LOST its header params (originName/onEdit*/stops/onAddStop/onEditStops/
  onSwap/onClose) and keeps mode chips / time chooser / routes / Start, plus the fork-only
  `flockOnRoute`. The card hides while the search overlay, pick-on-map, steps preview or stops
  editor own the screen; it uses colorScheme tokens (it replaces the search bar), NOT SheetPalette.
  MapScreen measures its bottom edge (`topCardBottomPx`) and passes `cameraTopInsetPx` to
  VelaMapView so the route fit frames below the card. The card has NO auto-focus on purpose - the
  panel's Drive tab keeps `rememberDpadAutoFocus()`. Heads-up InfoCards sit UNDER the measured card
  in directions mode (the 96dp constant was tuned for the search bar); with stops present a compact
  + button under the swap adds another stop (upstream cc691c0f). DIFF-ONLY verdict on cc691c0f's
  third change: upstream deleted the "Rerouted to avoid cameras" flash, the fork KEEPS it (kept
  once already in the 2026-07-14 smalls batch; the under-card offset removes upstream's overlap
  complaint, and the flash is real information when the list auto-picks a different route).
- **Chip style = stadium pills:** EVERY chip (map CategoryChips, results-panel filter
  chips Open-now/top-rated/price/sort + the collapsed "N results" pill, PlaceSheet travel-mode chips
  now with a leading `Icons.Default.Directions*` glyph, Settings vibrate-on-turns FilterChips) sets
  `shape = androidx.compose.foundation.shape.CircleShape` - full-radius pills, Google-style. Keep any
  new chip on CircleShape; monochrome leading icons (tint `onSurface`, not the teal primary) so it
  reads single-ink like Google's.
- **Search-results sheet - BOTTOM sheet with drag detents (`MapScreen.SearchResults`).**
  - Results rise from the BOTTOM, Google-style. It renders with the other bottom surfaces in
    MapScreen's bottom `when` (nav / directions / place sheet win the slot first) and shares the
    place sheet's detent grammar: **MINIMIZED** (a short "N results" bar; = the VM's
    `resultsCollapsed`, so the back gesture and the sheet agree) ↔ **PEEK** (~0.42 list cap) ↔
    **EXPANDED** (~0.82, fills the screen).
  - Handle TAP steps up; drag UP grows a detent, DOWN shrinks one; the nested-scroll connection steps
    ONE detent per gesture (re-armed in `onPreFling`), a hard fling can cross two (matches Google).
  - **BACK also steps one detent** - `resultsExpanded` is HOISTED to MapScreen so the BackHandler
    does expanded → peek → minimized → CLEARED (a back on the minimized bar runs `clearSearch()` to
    the bare map, not exit the app); and the sheet modifier carries `statusBarsPadding()` so the
    expanded handle pill stops below the clock / camera cutout.
  - **Camera frames the result CLUSTER:** the marker-fit branch in VelaMapView median-centers the
    pins and drops outliers past 4x the median spread (min 40 km) so one stray far hit can't zoom to
    a continental view; it fits with the results-sheet bottom inset (0.50 screen) so pins sit above
    the sheet; `lastFittedMarkersKey` re-arms while the sheet is minimized so expanding re-frames;
    and the fit CONSUMES `lastCameraTarget` (else the recenter branch re-fires on the STALE VM center
    and yanks the camera back to before the search).
  - There is **NO "hide results" button**.
  - **Filter chips are `ElevatedFilterChip` with an explicit filled `chipColors`** (subtle alpha
    tint off, solid `primary` teal + check on, `border = null`).
  - **Chrome:** `resultsShown` (peek/expanded) hides the scale bar / locate FAB / "Search this
    area"; `resultsMinimized` shows them again but LIFTED by `chromeLift` (76dp). The compass is
    MapLibre's built-in (`setCompassMargins`), which fades facing north (Google's behaviour) and
    reappears when rotated/tilted or during heading-up nav. Its browse-mode top margin is
    statusBar + 122dp so it sits BELOW the floating search bar and the category chips (8dp under the
    status bar put it exactly behind the bar, a half-hidden circle - ported from upstream `292f8d6`).
- **Map tap resolution order (`VelaMapView` click listener).** A single tap (24dp hit box) resolves,
  in priority:
  - (1) our search-result pin → `onMarkerTap`;
  - (2) an ambient Google POI dot → `onAmbientTap`;
  - (3) a greyed alternate route line → `onSelectAlternate`;
  - (4) a NAMED basemap POI (a business) → `onPoiTap`;
  - (5) a **HOUSE-NUMBER label** (basemap `vela-housenumber` `housenumber` or the address overlay
    `vela-addr-*` `number`, queried by layer id) → `onAddressLabelTap(number, labelPoint)`;
  - (6) an unnamed POI icon (has `class`, no name) → reverse-geocode at the tap;
  - (7) a **BUILDING footprint** (`building`/`building-3d` basemap fill or the `vela-ovl-*` overlay
    fill, queried by layer id) → reverse-geocode at the tap;
  - else nothing (only a long-press drops a raw coordinate pin on empty land).
  - **The house-number case must SNAP to the tapped number:** `MapViewModel.onAddressLabelTap` LEADS
    the pin with the label's own number and uses the reverse-geocode only for the street/city,
    replacing whatever house number the geocode led with (a regex strips `^\s*\d+\S*\s+` then
    prepends the tapped number) - Google's reverse-geocode snaps to the nearest ADDRESSABLE point,
    which for a tapped OSM label routinely returns a NEIGHBOUR. A real business sitting on the point
    still wins (if the geocode has a rating/category it's shown as-is).
- **Place-content toggles:** `ShowReviews` / `LoadPhotos` reactive holders
  (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, same shape as `LiveReviews`, init in VelaApp, rows in Settings → Map).
  They gate BOTH fetch (`fetchReviews`/`fetchPhotos` first line) and render (PlaceSheet `hasReviews`
  + the photo-hero `if`), so off = zero scrape traffic. Keep any new review/photo surface behind them.
- **"Hide adult categories" toggle:** `HideAdult` holder (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, default **off**, init
  in VelaApp, row in Settings → Map).
  - It flips `CategoryFilter.enabled` (a `:core` flag) - `:core`'s `data/CategoryFilter` filters
    adult/nightlife/alcohol/gambling/smoking places at the `GoogleMapsDataSource.search`/
    `nearbyPlaces` seam.
  - Match is CATEGORY-only (never name) and PRECISE (`EXACT`/`PHRASE`, food "…bar" kept); the keyword
    lists are **multilingual** (categories arrive localized via `hl=<lang>`, so the filter must too).
    Unit-tested (`CategoryFilterTest`).
  - NB the `:core` flag pattern (not reading the app holder from `:core`) is deliberate - mirror it
    for any future content gate that must act inside `:core`.
- **"Hide website & external links" toggle:** `HideExternalLinks` holder
  (`ui/PlaceContent.kt`, default **off**, init in VelaApp, row in Settings → Map). Gates the Website
  pill/row and the Book/Reserve/Order action in `PlaceSheet` (Street View is NO LONGER here - it
  opens the in-app panorama, gated instead by `!RESTRICTED_BUILD`; see the Street View bullet). No restricted build
  flavor / LockableToggle machinery; keep holders in the plain `ShowReviews` shape. Gate any new
  external-link surface on a place page behind this holder.
- **VelaDialog buttons are a FlowRow: filled pill confirm + text dismiss (upstream 837c7b00 +
  605ade01, ported 2026-07-15).** The confirm button renders as a filled primary pill (the
  recommended action reads at a glance), dismiss stays a plain text button, and `dismissLowEmphasis`
  renders dismiss quieter still (used by the voice offer's "Use system voice"). The button row is a
  `FlowRow`: when the two labels do not fit one line - "Download Vela Voice" on a small screen - the
  pill wraps to its own full-width line instead of being squeezed into a mid-word break (the exact
  "Download Vela / voice" mess a user screenshot showed). D-pad behaviour unchanged: dismiss
  auto-focuses, arrows reach confirm. **RING CONTRAST RULE (fork fix upstream lacks):** a control
  FILLED with the primary colour must pass `dpadHighlight(shape, ringColor = onPrimary)` - the
  default primary ring is invisible on a primary fill (device-found: the focused Download pill
  showed NO focus indication on a keypad phone). `dpadHighlight`'s `ringColor` param exists for
  exactly this; use it on any future primary-filled focusable.
- **External link buttons -> real browser only (`ui/ExternalLinks.kt`, 2026-07-15).** The EIGHT
  buttons that leave the app for a web page (PlaceSheet: Website pill + row, Book/Reserve/Order,
  Open in Google Maps; Settings: Support Vela + privacy policy; map: donate prompt + notice
  "Learn more") call `ExternalLinks.open(context, url)` instead of a bare
  `startActivity(ACTION_VIEW)`. Why: keypad phones ship a preinstalled FAKE browser (a system
  WebView shell that renders an error page for every URL) and a bare ACTION_VIEW sent every link
  button into it. `open()` resolves ACTUAL browsers first - an app declaring MAIN +
  CATEGORY_APP_BROWSER (how real browsers self-identify, incl. system Chrome), or any NON-SYSTEM
  app handling a generic https VIEW (a user-installed browser APK, whatever it declares). None ->
  toast `R.string.no_browser_installed` ("Your device does not have a browser", all 15 locales) and
  nothing opens; default handler not a real browser -> the intent is PINNED (`setPackage`) to a
  real one, so the shell can never open even as the system default. Gotchas baked in: (1) the
  manifest `<queries>` entries (https VIEW/BROWSABLE + MAIN/APP_BROWSER) are LOAD-BEARING - without
  them Android 11+ package visibility hides every browser and all links would toast; (2)
  SCHEME-LESS urls are web urls - Google's place payload stores bare domains
  ("moldovarestaurantbrooklyn.com") and the raw-intent passthrough must not see them (device-found
  hole); (3) non-web schemes (tel:, geo:, package-archive installs) pass through untouched. SCOPE
  IS LINK BUTTONS ONLY - never route the in-app WebView fetchers, voice/graph downloads, the
  updater, or share/export intents through this. Route any NEW "open a web page" button through
  `ExternalLinks.open`. Device-proven on both flavors: toast with no browser, toast after a live
  root-disable, real-browser open with the fake still the system default. The donate URL it opens
  is upstream's Buy Me a Coffee page (upstream d6e8230f; donations go to the upstream author).
- **In-app Street View (`streetview/PanoramaView` + `ui/place/StreetViewScreen`, upstream
  streetview-inapp ported 2026-07-16).** The place-sheet Street View pill opens a KEYLESS panorama
  in-app - not a hand-off to Google's app, not a WebView. Pipeline: `MapDataSource.streetView`
  (keyless `GeoPhotoService.SingleImageSearch`, referer-authorised) resolves the nearest pano ->
  `StreetViewParser` (POSITIONAL, `CALIBRATE:`-class: `[1][2][3][1]` tile size, `[1][5][0][8]`
  history stack, etc. - pinned to a live capture, unit-tested with a fixture) -> tiles from
  `streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/tile` stitched by `StreetViewTiles` onto a GLES20
  equirect sphere. Copy-Google shortcut: a search result's own SV thumbnail carries the exact
  panoid+yaw (`SearchParser.svThumb`, regex not a pb index), used verbatim when present. Half-screen
  over the map with a rotating pegman view-cone (`SV_LAYER`/`svPose` in VelaMapView), drag-look,
  walk arrows, time-travel history, full-screen toggle. **GATED OUT of the restricted flavor**
  (`!app.vela.ui.RESTRICTED_BUILD` in PlaceSheet) by fork policy - it still hits googleapis, so
  the content-minimal build omits the pill (compile-time constant, R8-stripped). This is why SV was
  REMOVED from the `HideExternalLinks` block and from the `ExternalLinks` browser-gate list (it is no
  longer an external link). Endpoints are remote-calibratable (`Calibration.streetViewMetaUrl`/
  `streetViewPanoUrl`); the tile template needs no calibration. Device-verified end to end in
  Philadelphia; NB a hosts-blocked device (AdAway redirecting `streetviewpixels-pa` to 127.0.0.1)
  fails tiles with a ConnectException - that's the device, not the code (host curl returns 200).
  **D-pad (fork-only, `StreetViewScreen`): the GL pano is a raw-View gesture (`onTouchEvent` +
  `ScaleGestureDetector`) so it needs a key path (rule 3) - `PanoramaView.panByFraction`/`zoomStep`
  are called by an ENGAGE-model onKeyEvent (mirrors MapDpadController): OK engages, arrows look,
  +/- zoom, OK-engaged walks to the nearest-facing neighbour, BACK disengages. The overlay controls
  (Close/Fullscreen/Time) OVERLAP the fullscreen pano box, so spatial focus nav fails - they use an
  EXPLICIT FocusRequester ring instead (pano->close->full->time). Robust `dpadAutoFocus` (not the weak
  remember- variant, which raced the search bar and left the viewer unfocused). audit_static was
  extended to catch a raw-View `onTouchEvent`/`ScaleGestureDetector` without a key path (it only
  scanned Compose gestures before - this bug slipped through once).
- **In-app updater (`app/update/SelfUpdater.kt`).**
  - Reads `releases/latest` from `alltechdev/vela-dpad` → tag `v0.0.<run>` → versionCode = `<run>`
    compared to BuildConfig; newer → `MapUiState.updateInfo` card on the bare map.
  - Download = no-call-timeout client (~80 MB APK) + zip-magic check → `filesDir/updates/`
    (FileProvider `updates` path) → ACTION_VIEW package-archive; the OS verifies same package +
    signature.
  - Launch check ~daily behind `self_update_check` (Settings → Version, default on); manual
    Check-for-updates button there too. "Not now" stores `update_dismissed_code` (only a NEWER
    release re-offers).
  - The tag parse takes the run number for the versionCode; update `SelfUpdater.check` if the
    versionCode scheme ever changes.
- **Zoomed-in pan perf:**
  - (1) `reportScale` (fires per camera-move FRAME) only pushes to compose when mpp moved >1% - an
    unconditional write recomposed the scale bar every pan frame; keep the gate.
  - (2) Both house-number layers (`vela-housenumber` basemap + `vela-addr-N` overlay) carry
    `textIgnorePlacement(true)`: they still YIELD to icons (allow-overlap stays false) but never
    enter the collision index - cheaper placement at street zoom and numbers can't evict icons
    whatever the layer order.
  - (3) `ui/Buildings3d` holder + Settings → Map "3D buildings" toggle sets visibility on the basemap
    `building-3d` fill-extrusion layer (a LaunchedEffect in VelaMapView owns visibility; applyLight/
    applyDark only colour it) - extrusion is the fragment-heavy layer, the documented 5a-class
    stutter source at z16+.
- **Light/dark is `AppTheme` (`ui/theme/AppTheme.kt`), not the OS.** Read the
  in-app theme with the composable **`isAppInDarkTheme()`** - never call
  `isSystemInDarkTheme()` directly in app UI (it ignores the user's Light/Dark/
  System choice in Settings → Appearance). `AppTheme.mode` is a process-wide
  reactive `mutableStateOf` (same shape as `ui/Units`), persisted to
  `vela_settings`, `init()`-ed in `VelaApp`; flipping it recomposes the theme and
  reloads the map style (`VelaMapView`'s styleKey carries `dark=`).
- **Basemap layer gotchas (`VelaMapView.ensureLayers`/`applyLight`/`applyDark`, OpenFreeMap Liberty).**
  - (1) **`maxzoom` is EXCLUSIVE** - the bundled `building` FILL layer is `minzoom 13 / maxzoom 14`,
    so `setMinZoom(14f)` alone collapses its range to empty and the flat footprints never paint
    (you'd see only the faint `building-3d` extrusion). The fill needs a matching **`setMaxZoom(24f)`**
    to re-open the top; keep it. `building-3d` (fill-extrusion) is gated to **z16+** on purpose (the
    flat fill carries the browse-zoom footprint look; extrusion is the per-pixel-expensive part on a
    Pixel 5a).
  - (2) **House numbers** render via the runtime `vela-housenumber` SymbolLayer (OMT `housenumber`
    source-layer, `minZoom 19` - house numbers only at the ~50 ft scale; 17.5 still carpeted whole blocks, 2026-07-13) - OpenFreeMap
    **does** serve that source-layer (verified vs the live TileJSON + z14 tiles), so it works;
    coverage is OSM `addr:housenumber` (partial), not a render bug.
  - (3) The runtime loads the style from the **LIVE** URL `MapStyle.LIBERTY.uri =
    https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty` (`fromUri`), and offline downloads use the same URL
    - both **auto-follow OpenFreeMap's current tile snapshot**, so there is NO dated-path/
    blank-basemap risk. The bundled `liberty-roboto.json` asset (which pins a dated `planet/<snapshot>`
    path) is **parked + unused** - the `asset://`/`fromJson` path in `VelaMapView` is dead code kept
    only as reference; don't be misled by its stale path.
  - Verify basemap edits on-device in **both** themes.
  - **A style dies the instant `map.setStyle` is called; guard every deferred access.** During a
    light/dark flip the OLD `Style` object becomes invalid immediately, and ANY access to it (even
    reading `.layers`) throws "Calling getLayers when a newer style is loading" - not just mutation.
    The overlay `LaunchedEffect`s are keyed on `darkTheme`, so they re-run in the load window against
    the stale reference and crashed the app. So: null `styleRef` FIRST (before `setStyle`, re-set in
    the callback) and wrap each effect's style enumeration/getLayer/setProperties in `runCatching`.
    (Ported from upstream `328a5ab`.)
- **D-PAD-FIRST IS THE FORK'S REASON TO EXIST - NON-NEGOTIABLE (read before touching ANY UI).**
  Vela must be **100% operable with a 5-key D-pad (↑ ↓ ← → + OK) and hardware BACK, on a device with
  NO touchscreen** (a feature phone). Touch is a *bonus*, never a requirement. A change that
  regresses it is a **release blocker**. Every rule below is MANDATORY for any new or edited UI and is
  **enforced by `tests/dpad/` - run the auditors before every UI commit, wire `audit_static.sh`
  into CI**:
  1. **Opens already focused.** Every screen / overlay / sheet / dialog / menu lands focus on a
     primary element the instant it appears. Attach `rememberDpadAutoFocus()`. The bare map is the ONE
     exception (it opens ambient; the first arrow reaches the search bar). Menus/dialogs: use
     `VelaMenu`/`VelaDialog` (a stock Compose `DropdownMenu`/`AlertDialog` **cannot** be pre-focused -
     proven; never use them for new UI).
  2. **Every interactive element is focusable WITH A VISIBLE RING.** Any `.clickable` /
     `.combinedClickable` / `.toggleable` / `.selectable` needs `Modifier.dpadHighlight(shape)` in its
     chain (Material's default indication is too faint on Vela's grey sheets). Material
     buttons/chips/switches keep their built-in indication (OK). A bare `.focusable()` is allowed ONLY
     if it draws its own affordance (the map target's crosshair/pill, a full-screen viewer).
  3. **Every gesture has a key path.** Any `detect*Gestures` / `draggable` / `swipeable` /
     `awaitPointerEventScope` / `.scrollable` must have an `onKeyEvent` or a focusable control that
     does the same thing, in the same composable. The map's pan/zoom/tap live on `MapDpadController`.
  4. **No focus traps.** BACK always exits a surface. A text field in a vertical list gets
     `Modifier.dpadFieldEscape()` (UP/DOWN escape it). A **vertical-list screen swallows bare
     LEFT/RIGHT** with `Modifier.dpadSwallowHorizontal()` (on the scroll container AND any lone control
     outside it, e.g. a top-bar back button) - a no-target horizontal move otherwise CLEARS focus
     irrecoverably in a `verticalScroll` Column.
  5. **Dialogs & menus MUST fit a small screen.** Wrap dialog/menu content in a `verticalScroll` (or
     `LazyColumn`) capped to a fraction of the screen height so a tall body scrolls and the buttons
     stay on-screen. (`VelaDialog`/`VelaMenu` already do this; keep it.)
  6. **Touch stays byte-identical.** Every D-pad affordance is gated on `rememberDpadMode()` /
     `rememberDpadFirstDevice()`; the touch path must be unchanged. Key device behaviour off the LIVE
     input mode where it matters (e.g. the search bar shows the soft keyboard on a touch tap, hides it
     on a D-pad OK - a hybrid touch+keypad phone reports `dpadMode` true but still wants touch typing).
  7. **Theme via `isAppInDarkTheme()`**, never `isSystemInDarkTheme()` in app UI.
  8. **Merge-friendly** (this fork rebases on upstream): new behaviour in new files
     (`DpadFocus.kt`/`VelaMenu.kt`/`VelaDialog.kt`/`MapDpadController.kt`), shared-file edits as small
     anchored insertions, one commented D-pad import block per file. **Reuse the helpers - do not
     reinvent** `dpadHighlight`/`dpadAutoFocus`/`dpadSwallowHorizontal`/`dpadFieldEscape`/
     `dpadRowSibling` (the last wires LEFT/RIGHT across a button/chip row inside a vertical list that
     swallows bare L/R - or the row's siblings are unreachable; see issue #24).
  9. **Enforcement (two suites):** `tests/dpad/` - `audit_static.sh` (no device; every rule above
     as a source scan; **must be 0 violations**, CI-ready), `audit_dynamic.sh` (every surface opens
     focused, multi-axis traversal never loses focus + reaches all distinct elements, BACK exits),
     `run_all.sh` (per-surface). `tests/small_screen/` - the feature-phone twin:
     `audit_smallscreen.sh` (shrinks the display; nothing clipped off-screen) + `audit_dialogs.sh`
     (dialogs/menus scroll and keep buttons on-screen). A UI PR that fails ANY of these does not merge.
- **D-pad-only operation implementation (`docs/dpad.md`).**
  - Helpers in `app/ui/DpadFocus.kt` (`rememberDpadMode`/`rememberNoTouchDevice`/
    `Modifier.dpadHighlight`/`Modifier.dpadFieldEscape` - makes a text field's UP/DOWN escape it
    instead of being swallowed as a cursor move, so controls below the field stay reachable - and
    `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` - attach its `FocusRequester` to a screen's primary element so focus is
    PLACED on appearance, no wake-up keypress; retries because the node isn't attached on frame 1).
  - The map is key-driven via `app/ui/map/MapDpadController.kt` (wired in `VelaMapView`, key handling
    + crosshair + zoom buttons in `MapScreen`).
  - **Detection is CONSERVATIVE - do not loosen it.** `rememberDpadFirstDevice` (`detectDpadFirst`)
    returns true ONLY for a genuinely touchless device (`!FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN`) or a PHYSICAL
    (non-virtual) `InputDevice` with `SOURCE_DPAD`. It must NOT count the framework's Virtual
    aggregate device (id −1): it reports `KEYBOARD | DPAD` on essentially every phone, so counting it
    makes `dpadMode` always-true on ordinary phones and BREAKS the search bar (a tap no longer opens
    the field / raises the keyboard; the `+`/`−` zoom buttons show under touch).
  - A fake-touchscreen keypad phone is NOT D-pad-first then; it gets full D-pad operation reactively
    on the first key via `rememberDpadMode` (`dpadFirst || inputMode == Keyboard`). The soft keyboard
    in `SearchBar` is likewise keyed off the LIVE `inputMode`, not the static device type, so a touch
    tap raises it even on a hybrid phone.
  - Rules when touching UI: (1) every new interactive element must be focusable with a visible ring
    (`dpadHighlight`) and every new gesture needs a key alternative; (2) D-pad code CALLS THE TOUCH
    PATHS (the named `handleTap` lambda, `gestureMove`, `navUserZoom`) - never fork them; (3) all
    D-pad affordances gate on `dpadMode`/`noTouch` so touch UX stays byte-identical; (4) keep the
    diff merge-friendly - new behaviour in new files, shared-file edits as small anchored insertions
    (the one commented import block per file).
  - Search-overlay focus is subtle (armed field + explicit `searchExpanded` flag - THREE traps in
    docs/dpad.md: opens-on-focus, can't-BACK-out, and DOWN-must-escape-into-the-suggestions); don't
    "simplify" it back to bare field-focus.
  - Choose-on-map keeps the map pannable to place the pin (a `pickOnMap` exception in
    `mapTargetHidden`) and the directions panel is scroll-capped so **Start** is reachable with 4
    alternates.
  - The one raw WebView in the app - the full-screen "Read all reviews" panel (`ReviewsPanel`,
    `fullScreen`) - maps ↑/↓ to `pageUp`/`pageDown` + `requestFocus()`es so it scrolls by D-pad (a
    WebView's default is to hop focus between links, not scroll); exit is always hardware BACK via the
    `Dialog`'s `BackHandler`.
  - **NO screen/view may open with nothing focused** - Compose focus recovery is nondeterministic, so
    every screen attaches `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` to a primary element (Settings→back, Welcome→Get
    started, place sheet→handle, directions→Drive tab, steps→first row, reviews→back arrow); the map +
    photo gallery already self-focus. When adding a screen, give it an auto-focus target.
  - **Menus & dialogs (the hard one): a Compose `DropdownMenu` Popup / `AlertDialog` can NOT be
    pre-focused (~10 approaches proven to fail - requestFocus/moveFocus/synthetic KeyEvent); only a
    hand-built RAW `Dialog` with an explicit `.focusable()` element auto-focuses.** So use
    **`VelaMenu`** (`ui/VelaMenu.kt`, drop-in DropdownMenu: anchored DropdownMenu under touch,
    auto-focusing raw-Dialog chooser under D-pad) and **`VelaDialog`** (`ui/VelaDialog.kt`, drop-in
    two-button AlertDialog that auto-focuses its dismiss button) - NEVER a bare `DropdownMenu`/
    `AlertDialog` for new D-pad UI. Their buttons/items focus via `.focusable()`+`.onKeyEvent` (OK) +
    `pointerInput` (touch), NOT `.clickable` (whose nested focusable won't take requestFocus in a
    Dialog window).
- **Localization (i18n) is three layers, one control (`AppLocale`, `ui/`, same process-wide reactive
  holder shape as `AppTheme`).** `AppLocale.language` = "" (follow system) or a code; Settings →
  Language picks it.
  - (1) **Spoken nav** - the GENERATED turn-by-turn text is a per-language `NavStrings` table in
    `:core` (`core/i18n`), switched by `NavStringsRegistry`; `AppLocale.apply()` drives it. **BOTH
    routers feed it:** `RouteGeometry.osrmPhrase` (online OSRM) AND `GraphHopperRouteEngine.ghPhrase`
    (offline) map their maneuvers to the OSRM `(type, mod)` token pair and call
    `NavStringsRegistry.current().phrase(...)`, so offline routes localize through the same 11 tables.
    - **The chosen neural voice must actually speak that language** - `VoiceGuide` guards on
      `NeuralSynth.voiceLanguage` and, on a mismatch, falls back to a system TTS in the target
      language (or stays silent + fires a "get a matching voice" hint) rather than reading Russian nav
      text through the English Piper model.
  - (2) **UI chrome** - all ~330 user-facing `:app` strings live in `res/values/strings.xml`
    (English) + `res/values-<lang>/` for the 14 translated languages (fr de es it pt nl ru pl sv uk zh zh-rTW ja iw),
    referenced via `stringResource`/`getString`. The runtime switch is `AppLocale.wrap(context)`
    (overrides the Configuration locale, **no-op when following the system** so the default path is
    untouched) applied in **both** `MainActivity.attachBaseContext` (Compose UI) and
    `VelaApp.attachBaseContext` (ViewModel/notification `getString`); changing the language calls
    `recreate()`.
  - (3) **Google POI content** - the scrape's `hl=en` is rewritten to the app/system language at
    request time (`GoogleMapsDataSource.localized()`, no-op for English) so categories/hours/status/
    price come back localized. **The rewrite is GATED to `SearchParser.STATUS_LANGS` (= the 11
    keyword-table languages, keyed off `CLOSED_WORDS`)** - for any OTHER locale the scrape stays
    `hl=en`, because a status string in a language `parseOpenNow` can't read leaves openNow null
    forever and the UI can't colour open/closed; English text the English table handles is the safer
    fallback.
  - The **open/closed BOOLEAN is parsed from the localized status TEXT against a per-language keyword
    table** (`SearchParser.parseOpenNow(status, lang)`, `lang` = the same `Locale.getDefault()` that
    set `hl=`; CLOSED words are matched FIRST - "Opens 5 AM" / "Ouvre à 07:00" / "Fechado" / "Opent om
    9:00" are prefix-cousins of the open words, so open-first matching paints a closed Starbucks
    green).
  - **Do NOT resurrect the numeric status-code path** (`openFromCode`, paths `statusCodeRich`/
    `statusCodeSimple`): those ints are span/style markers, not open/closed codes (closed pharmacies
    carried "open" 6, an Open-24-hours place carried 13/4 and rendered red). `placeStatusColor(status,
    openNow)` colours from the boolean and refuses to green English text that literally reads closed
    even if fed `openNow=true`.
  - `gl` (region) still `us` - GPS-region `gl` is a follow-up.
  - **Dual-purpose literals stay inline on purpose** - strings that double as a logic key (place
    "Open"/"Closed" → status-colour parser, the map category chips / search-along-route chips are also
    the query, review sort/tab labels branch a `when`) are NOT in strings.xml; they localize only once
    display text is split from the logic key.
  - **Names/addresses/reviews are DATA - never translated.**
  - Adding a user-facing string means: add it to `values/strings.xml` AND all `values-<lang>/`, and
    match the `%1$s`/`%2$d` placeholder TYPE to the arg (Int → `%d`, else `%s`; a `%d` fed a String
    crashes).

## Working on the scraper

- The `pb` request *grammar* (`PbBuilder`) and `PolylineCodec` are correct and
  stable. The **field numbers, response array indices, and session regexes are
  NOT** - they're marked `CALIBRATE:` and must be pinned from a live capture of
  `maps.google.com` (devtools/mitmproxy). Never trust a remembered `pb` layout.
- Turn the real source on with `VelaConfig.USE_GOOGLE_SOURCE = true` after
  calibrating. Parsers throw `CalibrationNeededException` (routine, non-fatal)
  when shapes drift; the UI surfaces it as a notice.
- **Never embed a static Google API key.** Per-user `GoogleSession` bootstrap
  only - that's what keeps the NewPipe legal footing.
- **Remote calibration (`calibration.json` at the repo root).**
  - The `pb`/proto templates and endpoint URLs (search, directions, reviews, **photos** -
    `photosEndpoint`/`photosProto` for the `hspqX` gallery RPC) are remotely updatable: `CalibrationStore`
    (in `:core`, `config/`) fetches `calibration.json` from the repo's raw URL at launch and adopts it
    when its `version` is higher than the bundled `Calibration.DEFAULT`, provided every endpoint host is
    on the allowlist (`www.google.com`/`google.com`).
  - The bundle also carries **`defaultVoiceId`** (String - the Piper voice a fresh install downloads +
    activates), **`defaultVoiceSpeaker`** (int - only tunes libritts_r's 904 variants) and
    **`defaultVoiceSpeed`** (float - spoken-directions speed), so a favourite voice/speaker/pace can be
    pushed as everyone's default with a version bump + re-sign, no app release (a user's own
    `voice_model`/`voice_speaker`/`voice_speed` pick still wins). Shipped defaults (calibration **v13**):
    voice **HFC Female** (`en_US-hfc_female-medium`), speaker 14 (libritts only), speed **0.8×** -
    matched in the compiled `Calibration.DEFAULT` + `VelaPiper.DEFAULT_VOICE_ID`.
  - NB the neural voice lengthens pauses at periods by **splitting the utterance on sentence boundaries
    and splicing silence in-app** (`SpeechText.splitSentences` in `:core` + `PiperSynth.concat`) - sherpa-onnx's
    `silenceScale` config is a measured no-op on the Piper/VITS path, don't reach for it.
  - **Every fragment gets terminal punctuation before synthesis (`PiperSynth`):** a bare-ending fragment
    ("turn left") gives the model no final prosody contour, so it trails off and swallows the last
    consonant ("lef" instead of "left"). A `;` is appended to any fragment ending in a letter/digit;
    punctuation is language-neutral, so it's safe for every Piper voice.
  - Spoken text also runs through `SpeechText.spokenNumbers` in `EnNavStrings.expandForSpeech` - 3-digit
    **street ordinals** ("120th" → "one twentieth", **space not hyphen** - the hyphenated compound
    gets a reduced/flapped "-ty" from the neural voice) are pre-expanded so the neural G2P doesn't mangle
    them into "one, hundred and 28th" (only 100–999; 1–2 digit + 4-digit+ are left for espeak).
  - And `NavEngine` **does not announce the DEPART maneuver** - `NavSession.start` speaks it once
    ("Starting navigation. Head east on F St"); the engine skips it (distance ≈ 0), else the opener gets
    clipped by a re-announced "head out".
  - **Multiple downloadable voices (voice browser).** `VelaPiper` is one engine (`ENGINE_ID =
    "vela.piper"`) that holds ANY of many Piper voices, each in its own `filesDir/piper/<id>/` dir
    (`<id>.onnx` + `tokens.txt` + `espeak-ng-data/`, the sherpa `vits-piper-<id>` archive layout). The
    **installed set is derived from the filesystem** (`installedVoiceIds`, keeps only complete dirs → a
    partial download self-heals), the pick persists in **`voice_model`**, and **speaker choice is
    per-voice** (`voice_speaker_<id>`; the legacy global `voice_speaker` is migrated onto libritts_r).
  - The browsable catalog is `PiperCatalog` in `:core` (pure data, unit-tested, ~40 curated voices across
    11 languages; URL = `…/tts-models/vits-piper-<id>.tar.bz2`). `PiperSynth.ensureLoaded` reloads when
    the selected voice changes; `PiperSynth.reloadVoice()` is the SINGLE switch trigger - it bumps the
    generation counter (aborting any in-flight utterance) then tears down + rebuilds on the same serial
    worker, so `tts` is never freed mid-`generate()`. `MapViewModel.migrateFlatLayoutIfNeeded` (first
    thing in `init`) relocates the old flat single-voice install in place (rename, copy-fallback,
    verify-gated, re-runnable) - never re-downloads.
  - **Voice search (speak a query into the search bar), two tiers.** `ui/VoiceSearch` (process-wide
    reactive holder, `init` in `VelaApp`) resolves the mic mode. **tier-1 on-device** =
    `voice/WhisperRecognizer` (Whisper tiny int8 + Silero VAD via the SAME bundled sherpa-onnx AAR as
    Piper - `OfflineRecognizer`/`Vad`; the wholesale `com.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx.**` R8 keep already covers
    it) recording through `AudioRecord`; the model is `voice/AsrModel` (~58 MB, files in
    `filesDir/asr/whisper-tiny/`). **tier-2** = a `RECOGNIZE_SPEECH` intent hand-off to an installed
    voice-input app. The mic lives in `ui/search/SearchBar` (`onMic`, shown only when the mode isn't
    NONE); the listening sheet is `ui/VoiceCaptureDialog` (raw D-pad-focusable `Dialog`, Done
    auto-focuses); wiring + the RECORD_AUDIO launcher + the download-offer are in `MapScreen`; the
    Settings -> Search section (toggle, model download/remove, engine picker) is in `SettingsScreen`.
    Needs `RECORD_AUDIO` (manifest; asked at the mic tap).
    - **Model hosting: the `asr-models` GitHub release on THIS repo** (fixed-tag prerelease, like
      `routing-graphs`/`building-overlays`; `AsrModel.URL`). **The archive MUST be a `.tar.bz2` whose
      single top-level folder holds the 4 files** (`tiny-encoder.int8.onnx`, `tiny-decoder.int8.onnx`,
      `tiny-tokens.txt`, `silero_vad.onnx`) - `KokoroInstaller.download` (reused for the ASR download)
      unpacks bzip2 and RENAMES that inner folder to `AsrModel.dir`, so a `.tar.gz` or a flat/no-folder
      archive would fail to install. (The mirror was re-packed from upstream's `.tar.gz`; drop the macOS
      `._*` resource forks when re-packing.)
  - **Any large download (voice model, routing graph, building overlay) MUST NOT use the shared OkHttp
    client** - its `callTimeout(12s)` (scrape-bounding) aborts the body read mid-stream, `runCatching`
    eats it, and the asset SILENTLY never installs (no crash, no log). `KokoroInstaller`,
    `RoutingGraphStore`, `OverlayTileStore` **and `VoiceInstaller`** (the TTS-engine APK download; a
    >12 s APK fetch otherwise silently falls back to the F-Droid web page) each derive a `downloadHttp`
    with `callTimeout(0)` + `readTimeout(60s)` for the body; only the tiny manifest/version fetch stays
    on the shared short-timeout client. `OverlayTileStore.download` is also serialized behind a `Mutex`
    (+ a first-line "already installed" re-check) so two callers for the same region can't interleave
    writes into the one `.tmp` (whose 7-byte magic check could then pass on a corrupt archive).
  - Settings → Voice → **Voice library** is the browser; the multi-speaker variant picker (Advanced)
    only shows when the SELECTED catalog voice has >1 speaker.
  - **To ship a pb/endpoint fix WITHOUT an app release:** edit the drifted field in `calibration.json`,
    **bump `version`**, **re-sign** (`./scripts/sign-calibration.sh`), commit `calibration.json` +
    `calibration.json.sig` to `main` - users pick it up on their next launch (raw.githubusercontent
    caches ~5 min). Keep the compiled `Calibration.DEFAULT`'s field VALUES (paths, endpoints, voice
    defaults) in sync with `calibration.json` when you cut a release - but `DEFAULT.version`
    intentionally STAYS `1` (the remote bundle's higher `version` must always win the adopt-if-newer
    check; the shipped `calibration.json` is at v13, `DEFAULT.version` at 1 - that gap is by design).
  - **Phase 2: the search parser's positional field-index paths are remote too** - the `paths` object in
    `calibration.json` (`name`, `address`, `rating`, `photos`, `featureId`, … as `[i,j,…]` arrays,
    relative to a result entry whose place node is `[1]`; `results`/`single` are root-relative). So a
    "Google moved field X to a new index" fix is also just an edit + version bump.
  - **All three result-shape gates follow `paths.name`** - `singleResultEntry`, `atThisPlaceEntries` and
    `findResultsArray` wrap the candidate as `[null, node]` and validate through `pathOf(paths,"name")`
    instead of a hard-coded `at(11)`, so a `paths.name` recalibration reaches the single-result /
    address-snap / fallback paths too. And the WebView details/popular-times path
    (`PopularTimesParser.parse`) threads the LIVE `cal.paths` through `SearchParser.parse`/
    `parsePopularTimes` rather than pinning `DEFAULT_PATHS`.
- **Signed channel (mandatory).** The bundle is **ECDSA-P256/SHA-256 signed**
  (`calibration.json.sig`, detached, base64) and the app verifies it against the
  **public key pinned in `CalibrationStore.PINNED_PUBLIC_KEY`** before adopting -
  so a repo/CDN compromise can't push config *or code* to devices. The private key
  lives at `~/.vela-signing/vela-calibration.key` (**never commit it**; the public
  half is safe to embed). `scripts/sign-calibration.sh` signs + self-verifies;
  `BundleSignature.verify` (`:core`) is the unit-tested verifier. A bundle that
  fails verification is ignored (app keeps the last-good config). An unsigned/older
  cached copy falls back to the compiled `DEFAULT` for one launch.
- **Notices.** `calibration.json` carries a `notices` array (`id`/`level`/`title`/
  `body`/`url`) shown as dismissable cards on the bare map (`MapViewModel.refreshNotices`,
  dismissed ids in `vela_notices` prefs) - push "search is down, fix coming" with no
  app update. Rides the same signed channel.
- **Phase 3: remote parse *logic*** via `transformsJs`.
  - A signed JS bundle run in a **Rhino sandbox** (`JsSandbox`, interpreted/`optimizationLevel=-1` for
    ART, `initSafeStandardObjects` so it can't reach Java/IO; a private `ContextFactory` arms Rhino's
    instruction observer as a **2 s wall-clock kill switch** - a runaway `while(true)` in a pushed
    `transforms.js` throws an `Error` (which JS can't `catch`) → the `runCatching` becomes the
    compiled-Kotlin fallback, so it can't hang search or, via `synchronized(this)`, wedge every later
    transform (unit-tested); `org.mozilla:rhino-runtime`, R8-keep in `core/consumer-rules.pro`).
  - `JsTransforms` exposes two search hooks - `parseSearch(rawResponse)` (full re-parse of a reshaped
    response) and `transformPlaces(placesJson)` (post-process) - over the flat `PlaceJson` contract;
    **compiled Kotlin is always the fallback** (no script / missing fn / any error → unchanged).
  - So a *response-shape* change can be hot-fixed too, not just a moved field. Wired in
    `GoogleMapsDataSource.search`.

## Degoogled constraints (hard rules)

- Location: AOSP `LocationManager` only - never `FusedLocationProviderClient`. **Fix discipline
  (don't regress):**
  - NETWORK (BeaconDB) fixes are DROPPED during nav and used in browse only when GPS has been quiet
    ≥12 s (`NETWORK_FIX_QUIET_MS`, OsmAnd's `useOnlyGPS` pattern) - they're 100-1000 m off and
    teleported the dot/reroutes.
  - Inter-fix `dt` comes from `loc.elapsedRealtimeNanos` (monotonic - `loc.time` mixes GNSS UTC with
    the network system clock and a negative dt bypassed the outlier gate).
  - Fixes with accuracy >50 m never feed `NavSession`.
  - The `minDistanceM=0f` registration MUST stay 0 (a distance filter starves fixes at a standstill -
    the frozen-speedo/creeping-puck bug).
  - Measured speeds pass a SYMMETRIC accel-bounded gate against the last ACCEPTED value
    (`gateMeasuredSpeed`, 2-fix persistence escape, shared with replay) - one-sided spike filters
    self-latch (a down-glitch to 0 then rejects every real speed as an up-spike forever).
  - The registered `LocationListener` MUST be an explicit `object` overriding all four callbacks,
    NOT the SAM lambda. The lambda implements only `onLocationChanged`; the provider-state callbacks
    have default bodies only from Android 11, so on Android 10 and below the framework calls
    `onProviderDisabled` (a present-but-disabled NETWORK provider, common on degoogled devices) and
    the lambda dies with `AbstractMethodError` on every launch. (Ported from upstream `84ab10f`.)
- Nav guidance discipline:
  - prompt/turn-now distances SCALE WITH SPEED in `NavEngine` (max(fixed, v×T); `spoken` stores band
    SLOTS not metres);
  - one prompt per update speaking the TRUE distance, silent catch-up past maneuvers >75 m behind;
  - proximity arrival (crow ≤40 m) + no rerouting within 150 m of the destination or while stationary
    (EXCEPT a FAR deviation: `FAR_OFF_M` 90 m counts at ANY speed, upstream a8f46047 - parking-lot
    creep sits under the 2 m/s moving floor forever, so the reroute/redrawn line never came);
  - off-route measured on the windowed/anchored projection (never whole-polyline min); the corridor
    itself is ACCURACY-SCALED per mode (`NavEngine.offRouteCorridor(mode, accuracyM)` = base + K*acc,
    clamped foot<bike<drive; `farOffDistance` = 2x, capped) not a flat 40 m - clean GPS tightens it,
    noisy GPS widens it so multipath can't false-reroute (upstream faadbed6; NavSession feeds each
    fix's `loc.accuracy`, dead-reckoning passes null -> a typical default). The old `OFF_ROUTE_M`/
    `FAR_OFF_M` stay as `NavEngine.update` DEFAULTS so replays/other callers are unchanged;
  - TUNNEL DEAD RECKONING (`MapViewModel.tunnelDeadReckonLoop`, upstream a8f46047): the engine only
    advances on fixes, so a GPS outage froze the whole stack; when the guidance feed goes quiet
    >3.5 s while navigating, on-route, not replaying and not from a standstill, the VM synthesizes
    1 Hz fixes ALONG the route at the last speed (decay tau 60 s, floor 1.5 m/s, cap 3 km) through
    the NORMAL `navSession.onLocation` path - puck/banner/voice keep working, `navStarved` keeps the
    "Searching for GPS" chip up for honesty, the first real fix re-anchors. Never feeds trip
    recording (no fake points in trips). Nav zoom range is 18.0->15.5 (was 17.3->15.0); GTFS stop
    icons hide during nav (declutter effect nulls `lastAppliedAmbient` so applyData re-asserts the
    OSM POI visibility, and the VM skips the stop fetch); the nav-end camera reset is one INSTANT
    move zeroing bearing/tilt/padding in a single snap (an animated level-out got cancelled
    mid-flight by the next camera write and left the browse map partially rotated);
  - reroutes are single-flight + cooldown + latch-clear-on-failure (a failed fetch must NOT kill
    rerouting - the event is edge-triggered);
  - WRONG-WAY heading term (upstream 14157b79): a moving fix coursing >60 deg against the route's
    local bearing counts as an off-route hit even INSIDE the distance corridor (a wrong turn onto a
    nearby-parallel road never latched on distance alone), and it resets `onRouteStreak` so the
    back-on-course discard can't kill the legit reroute mid-fetch. `NavSession.onLocation` takes
    `bearingDeg`; the VM passes the fix's course. Unit-tested both ways;
  - while off-route the TOP nav card is a Rerouting headline (spinning refresh glyph, draw-phase
    rotation, no recomposition; signs/instruction cleared) and the reroute announcement is chime +
    spoken word + a distinct 3-tick+long-buzz haptic under the per-mode vibrate setting (upstream
    aa426ed5/204455da/ff8cb3c4). The chime is synthesized in-process on the guidance stream
    (`VoiceGuide.reroutingChime`) - silent when muted, never an asset;
  - nav START never blocks on the traffic-light Overpass fetch (upstream 5e3250ae, adapted): the
    session starts on the plain route and `NavSession.applyEnrichedRoute` folds the light clauses in
    afterward (same polyline, text-only swap, no phantom trip-log entry). This fork KEEPS the
    off-by-default Settings toggle (`enrichLightsIfEnabled`), unlike upstream where light guidance is
    standard. A `navStartJob` guard makes Start re-entrancy-safe (double-tap spoke twice);
  - approach prompts are ~35 s / ~10 s out (were 25/8; floors unchanged so city/walking behaviour is
    byte-identical - upstream real-drive A/B vs Google, 43f67fdd);
  - VOICE HONESTY (upstream a0a87996/570ffd6c/317e736e/603ebc9b/8d9abf1f voice slices, all
    unit-tested): sub-mile spoken distances use quarter-mile fractions ("In half a mile"); a step's
    2nd/3rd prompts drop the sign-destination tail (`NavStrings.repeatShort`); a MERGE announces at
    most twice; the first prompt speaks only the primary sign destination (`NavStrings.spokenSign`,
    colon-anchored to " toward " so times/addresses are safe); "Take exit 186" speaks as "take the
    186 exit" (espeak mis-vowels the bare adjacency); the banner headline shows the SAME spoken form
    (secondary cities as a dim one-liner below, fork's maxLines=2 cap kept) and the "then" row uses
    the short form;
  - the drawn nav puck is a +/-8 m along-route window average (upstream 14157b79) so it stops
    tracing lane-level micro-kinks; `pointAtMeters` is a binary search (3 calls per ticker frame);
  - ramp instructions say WHICH SIDE in all 15 language tables (OSRM modifier), and
    `RouteGeometry.consolidateExits` disambiguates a shared onramp's both-directions sign down to
    the taken branch + adopts the folded fork's lane diagram (`disambiguateDest`, conservative,
    unit-tested) (upstream 43f67fdd core slice);
  - ETA sums the remaining STEP durations × traffic ratio (never remaining/avg-speed).
  - The route line's driven/ahead cut is a GEOMETRY split (`ROUTE_AHEAD_LAYER` suffix over a
    traversed-grey full line) - MapLibre bakes line-gradients into a 256-texel texture (no crisp cut)
    and has no `line-trim-offset`; don't "simplify" it back to a gradient.
- Nav drive-report fixes:
  - (1) **Route line z-order** - the route line inserts BELOW the first symbol layer, but Liberty's
    first symbol is `road_one_way_arrow` (~idx 61) which sits UNDER the `bridge_*` layers (~63-82) →
    bridges paint over the route on bridges. `VelaMapView.ensureLayers` anchors instead to the first
    symbol AFTER the last `bridge_*` layer (a real label), so the route draws above all road+bridge
    geometry, still below text.
  - (2) **Exit consolidation** - OSRM splits one exit into ramp + fork/merge steps, each spoken
    separately ("Take exit 15"…"Keep right"…"Merge"). `RouteGeometry.consolidateExits` folds a ramp's
    immediately-following, <500 m-gapped FORK/MERGE run into the ramp maneuver (sums distances so they
    still tile the polyline; stops at any real turn / far gap) → one prompt. Unit-tested.
    - **Sibling `RouteGeometry.foldRenames`** folds a pure-rename CONTINUE (OSRM `continue`/`new name`
      going straight, no genuine fork - "Oak Ave becomes Cathcart Way") into the PRECEDING maneuver
      so it's not its own banner card / step at all (NavEngine already silences its voice). Applied on
      BOTH routers (OSRM `parseOsrmRoute` + GraphHopper `toRoute`); a genuine-fork CONTINUE
      (`continueHasGenuineFork`, spoken) and STRAIGHT (a junction straight-through) are left alone.
      Unit-tested.
  - (3) **Feet steps** - `formatDistance` (banner) + all 11 `NavStrings.spokenDistance` (voice) round
    feet Google-style: 50 ft at/above 100 ft, 10 ft below.
  - (4) **Voice K/C** - `EnNavStrings.expandForSpeech` rewrites `<XX>-<n>` (CA-99, SR-99) → "State
    Route n" so espeak's G2P doesn't mangle the bare 2-letter code's onset.
  - (6) **Continue/straight lane silence** - a CONTINUE/STRAIGHT speaks its lane preface ONLY for a
    GENUINE fork (an "off" lane whose OWN indication is an explicit `straight`/`slight*` arrow, e.g.
    "use the left 2 lanes to stay on I-80"); a plain turn bay at an intersection (off lane marked only
    `left`/`right`, OR **`none`** = OSRM's "no painted arrow" sentinel, NOT "goes straight") while you
    sail straight through is silenced (`Route.continueHasGenuineFork` gates `NavEngine`'s escape hatch;
    it matches only `straight`/`slight*` on an off lane - `none`/`through` are excluded).
  - (5) **Traffic-light landmarks ("pass the light, then turn") - BUILT (Settings → Navigation →
    "Traffic-light guidance", OFF by default, English-only):** `RouteGeometry.enrichWithLights` folds a
    "pass the light, then …" clause into a surface-street TURN when 1–2 signals fall on the approach
    (`NavStrings.passLights`); signals from `OverpassTrafficSignals.fetchAlong` (keyless Overpass).
    - **Two refinements (unit-tested):** it EXCLUDES a signal AT the turn vertex itself (that's the
      light you turn at, not one you pass first - `distanceTo(turnPt) >= LIGHT_SNAP_M`), and it CLUSTERS
      matched signals within `LIGHT_CLUSTER_M` (30 m) before counting, because OSM maps one
      `traffic_signals` node per approach/carriageway at a junction - raw-node counting said "pass 2
      lights" for one intersection. Still needs a real-drive calibration of the thresholds.
- Nav fixes, round 2:
  - (1) **Replay arrow** - the arrow's visibility keys on the `displayBearing` passed to `applyData`
    (`VelaMapView` ~730), which prefers snap/compass/`myBearing`; recorded traces often carry no
    per-fix bearing, so with no route snap it went null and hid the arrow. Now falls back to the
    engaged puck's OWN route-derived heading (`navPuck.displayBearing`, seeded from the road segment by
    the motion ticker) while navigating.
  - (2) **Replay GPS snap-back** - `replayTrip` cancels+nulls `locationJob`, but `startLocation()` is
    guarded only by `locationJob != null`, so a permission callback / MapScreen effect re-started the
    live collector mid-replay and its real fixes overwrote `myLocation`+`center`. Two guards:
    `startLocation()` no-ops while `replaying`, and the live collector drops every fix while
    `replaying`. Replay's `finally` resumes live GPS once `replaying=false`.
  - (2b) **Replay teardown** (stop or natural end) - the `navSession→state` observer keeps
    `activeRoute` once nav stops (`else it.activeRoute`), so the `finally` must explicitly null
    `activeRoute`/`routes`/`directionsOpen`/step preview; and it snaps `myLocation`/`center` back to
    the user's real PRE-replay location (`resumeLoc`, captured in `replayTrip`). Gated on `ownedNav` (a
    replay riding an already-active nav leaves that route/location alone).
  - (3) **U-turn / back-on-course** - a U-turn strays >45 m → `RerouteNeeded` → async directions fetch
    (~1-3 s); but the U-turn outlasts the fetch, and by the time it lands the driver has rejoined the
    ORIGINAL line. `reroute()` captures `fromRoute` and, before adopting, discards the result if the
    driver is SOLIDLY back on it - `route === fromRoute && nav.onRouteStreak >= BACK_ON_COURSE_HITS(2)`.
    - **NOT bare `!offRoute`**: the offRoute latch clears on a SINGLE grazing fix (and `offDist` can
      match a parallel/overlapping leg), so one spurious graze would kill a legit missed-turn reroute.
      So `NavState.onRouteStreak` (consecutive on-corridor+moving fixes, computed in `NavEngine` beside
      `offRouteHits`, reset the instant off) gates it - a graze can't reach 2, a real rejoin does.
      Self-healing (a re-deviation re-fires the edge; no cooldown charged). Threshold tunable from a
      real-drive U-turn capture.
  - (4) **Traffic incidents** - DEFERRED: no keyless real-time source (Google keyless response carries
    none; incident tiles are proprietary binary; OSM has only stale roadworks; DOT/511 needs a token +
    is per-state). Congestion colouring already shows where it's slow. See ROADMAP.
- Heading (browse-cone facing direction when stopped, where GPS course is noise): raw
  `SensorManager` `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR` (`core/location/HeadingProvider`) - a plain
  Android sensor, not GMS. **Navigation never uses it** (the nav heading comes from the
  matched road); it's pushed to state only in browse + only on a real change, so it can't
  spam recomposition during nav.
- Nav-puck speed fusion: raw `TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION` + `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`
  (`core/location/MotionProvider` → world-frame accel; `core/location/SpeedKalman` fuses it
  with GPS speed - accel predicts between fixes, each fix measures). Collected ONLY during
  nav, written into a plain array (never compose state - sensor-rate recomposition). Missing
  sensors degrade to `a = 0` = the old constant-speed dead reckoning.
- Voice: AOSP `TextToSpeech`, engine-selectable - never hard-depend on Google TTS.
  - **Plus an in-process neural option (Piper):** Vela bundles the **sherpa-onnx** runtime (arm64
    `.so`, from the `tts-runtime` release AAR - gitignored, fetched in CI, NOT committed) and downloads
    a **Piper VITS** voice into `filesDir/piper/<id>/`, run in-process by `app/voice/PiperSynth` (sherpa
    `OfflineTts` + `AudioTrack`) behind the `:core` `voice/NeuralSynth` seam (the AAR can't live in the
    `:core` library module). The default is **HFC Female** (`en_US-hfc_female-medium`, ~67 MB), the
    default once present.
  - **Non-obvious, all device-only (compiler-clean):** R8 MUST `-keep class com.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx.**`
    (JNI resolves classes by original name); and you must generate the WHOLE utterance before
    `AudioTrack.play()` (streaming underruns → AudioFlinger drops the track → SIGABRT).
  - The whole utterance is generated, but it's **written to the track in ~200 ms chunks with a
    `generation` check between them** (`PiperSynth`) so an interrupt (turn-now/rerouting/stop) takes
    effect within ~200 ms instead of blocking for the full utterance - safe against the SIGABRT rule
    because back-to-back chunk writes keep the buffer full (no underrun).
  - **Audio-focus is refcounted via the utterance callbacks; two leaks closed:** a system-TTS `speak()`
    returning `ERROR` enqueues no utterance so no callback ever fires - `VoiceGuide.speakViaSystem`
    rolls back the focus acquire on `ERROR`; and a failed system-TTS `onInit` used to queue every prompt
    into `pending` forever - it now clears `pending`, latches `systemInitFailed`, and fires
    `langUnavailable` instead.
  - **A Piper voice is a SINGLE-language model** - reading another language's nav text through it is
    gibberish. `NeuralSynth.voiceLanguage` exposes the loaded voice's lang (id prefix, `en_US-hfc_female`
    → "en"); `VoiceGuide.speakNow` compares it to the language the nav text is GENERATED in
    (`NavStringsRegistry.current().locale`) and, on a mismatch, routes to **Android `TextToSpeech` in the
    target language instead** (`speakViaSystem`, lazily creating a default engine as the fallback - the
    system `tts` is NOT shut down when the neural voice is active). If the system TTS has no voice for
    that language either, guidance stays **silent** (never mangles it through the wrong voice) and fires
    `langUnavailable(lang)` → `MapViewModel` flashes a "get a &lt;language&gt; voice in Settings → Voice"
    hint.
  - **(History: earlier iterations bundled Kokoro (`KokoroSynth`) and Matcha, both removed after
    on-device A/B. `MapViewModel` reclaims their old model dirs and sanitizes stale `vela.kokoro`/
    `vela.matcha` prefs to Piper. `project_vela_kokoro_tts` memory is that historical record, not the
    current design.)**
- Nav feedback: spoken guidance (`VoiceGuide`) + **direction-coded haptic turn cues**
  (`core/feedback/Haptics`, `NavEvent.Haptic`); toggle in Settings → Navigation.
- EU consent: `InMemoryCookieJar` (CoreModule) pre-seeds Google's `SOCS`/`CONSENT`
  cookies so a cookieless EU session isn't bounced to `consent.google.com` - don't
  strip those, and don't let a `Set-Cookie` downgrade `CONSENT` to `PENDING`.
- No GMS: no FCM/Firebase/Play Integrity/Fused. If push is needed later, use
  UnifiedPush; crash reporting via ACRA/self-hosted Sentry.
- **Photos use a hidden WebView** (`app/web/WebPhotoFetcher`).
  - The full gallery RPC (`hspqX`) serves real photos only to a real browser engine - OkHttp gets a
    bot-degraded Street-View-only reply (TLS-fingerprint detection, not headers).
  - The WebView loads `maps.google.com` **anonymously (no login)** and same-origin-fetches the RPC.
    This is the one place we run Google's JS - an accepted tradeoff for richer photos (lazy,
    best-effort, OkHttp fallback).
  - Gotchas: **desktop UA** (mobile UA → Google deep-links to `intent://`), block non-http(s)
    redirects, and use a `Handler` not `View.postDelayed` (a headless WebView never attaches).
- **Routing is OPEN, not Google.**
  - Turn-by-turn comes from **FOSSGIS OSRM** (`RouteGeometry.route`, `steps=true`, per-mode
    `routed-car`/`-bike`/`-foot`) - complete, street-named maneuvers + real geometry.
  - **Highways identify by `ref` not `name`** - `parseOsrmRoute` captures `ref`/`destinations`/`exits`
    (not just `name`) and `osrmPhrase` uses them ("Take exit 72B toward …"); `Maneuver.ref` feeds the
    banner shield even when the text shows a name.
  - **`routeOsrm` retries 3× w/ backoff** - a transient community-server blip otherwise drops nav to
    Google's abbreviated (nameless) steps.
  - Google's keyless `/maps/preview/directions` returns **abbreviated** steps for longer routes (a
    6-mi route came back with 2 of ~10 turns), so it's demoted to (a) the **live-traffic source** -
    `GoogleMapsDataSource.applyTraffic` scales OSRM's free-flow duration by Google's in-traffic/typical
    ratio and maps its congestion spans onto the OSRM geometry - and (b) the **fallback router** when
    OSRM is unreachable. The two are fetched in parallel.
  - **`OSRM_BASE` is the FOSSGIS community server (fair-use) - point at a self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla
    before any real release.**
- **Traffic-AWARE routing (option 3).**
  - OSRM's free-flow route ignores live traffic, so when Google *rerouted around a jam* its path differs
    from OSRM's. `directions()` detects this (`RouteGeometry.divergent` - sample Google's polyline, true
    if any point strays >700 m from OSRM's line) and, only then, re-runs OSRM **through ~12 points
    sampled off Google's polyline** (`sampleVias` → `routeVia`) so we follow Google's jam-avoiding path
    *with* full OSRM street-named steps.
  - Multi-waypoint OSRM returns one leg per via with spurious `arrive`+`depart` at each boundary -
    `parseOsrmRoute` filters all but the true first-depart/last-arrive. Free-flow routes (the common
    case) stay pure OSRM, untouched.
  - The traffic-snapped route leads **only when it earns it** - its live ETA must be ≤ OSRM free-flow
    best × `SNAP_ETA_MARGIN` (1.2), else a divergent-but-not-faster snap steps aside for OSRM's clean
    route. The `directions` diag logs `snapKept`/`gEta`/`osrmFF` to tune the margin from real
    side-by-side data.
  - **Per-alternate re-rank:** each Google route in `root[0][1]` carries its OWN `duration_in_traffic`
    (`parseRoute` reads `summary[10][0][0]` per route), so the returned list is **sorted by live
    in-traffic ETA - fastest leads, Google-style.**
  - **Sort key = the EXACT value the picker shows:** `compareBy({ durationInTrafficSeconds ?:
    durationSeconds }, { provisional })`. `RouteOption` displays `durationInTrafficSeconds ?:
    durationSeconds` and tags the min-SHOWN route "Fastest", so the sort MUST use the same expression -
    else the top/selected route and the "Fastest"-tagged route diverge and the fastest-shown route
    isn't at the top. The axis is already fair without the fudge factor: PRIMARY routes go through
    `applyTraffic` (their `durationInTrafficSeconds` = free-flow × the top Google route's ratio) and
    Google's alternates carry their own per-route `duration_in_traffic`, so a route only falls back to
    raw `durationSeconds` when there's genuinely no traffic signal for it. Do NOT bake an estimate onto
    `durationInTrafficSeconds` to "fix the axis" - `Route.hasLiveTraffic` keys off its nullness.
    Provisional routes are the stable tie-break.
  - **Alternates = GOOGLE's own alternate routes, NAME-ON-PICK:** `directions()` returns the named
    primary + each distinct Google route as a **provisional** `Route` (`Route.provisional` - polyline +
    live ETA now, turn-by-turn deferred), `dedupeRoutes`, prefers them over OSRM's free-flow alts, caps
    at `MAX_ROUTES`=4. Picking a provisional alternate (`MapViewModel.selectRoute` →
    `MapDataSource.nameRoute`, also on `startNav` as a safety) NAMES it - by snapping its polyline
    through OSRM (`routeVia`, guarded to reach dest) + re-applying Google's traffic. So only the route
    you drive gets snapped, and the picker loads fast.
  - **Next = swap `nameRoute`'s snap for on-device GraphHopper MAP-MATCH where the region's downloaded**
    (wobble-free); the snap stays the fallback.
- **Why not "always snap to Google's path"?**
  - Google's keyless **polyline is complete** (decoded from `root[0][7][i]`) even though its *step text*
    is abbreviated - so we *can* always trace it.
  - But doing it cleanly needs **map-matching**, and the public infra won't reliably give it: FOSSGIS
    **`/match` caps at 10 trace coords** (11+ → `TooBig`; confidence ~0.01 at that sparsity) and public
    **Valhalla `/trace_route` times out**.
  - The serverless fallback - dense-waypoint `/route` (40–100 vias, no cap) - *does* reproduce Google's
    path exactly, **but a via landing on a turn gets swallowed into a via arrive/depart → ~1-in-10 named
    turns lost**, so we do **not** always-snap.
  - Clean always-snap (and offline routing) is gated on an **on-device engine** - see the next bullet.
    Option 3 is the public-server stopgap and stays as the online/fallback path. **No backend needed
    for any of this** (the serverless constraint holds).
- **On-device routing engine = GraphHopper (`core/data/RouteEngine` + `GraphHopperRouteEngine`).**
  - Pure-JVM, runs on ART - validated end-to-end on device long ago via the throwaway `:ghprobe`
    instrumented module (now retired; the routing itself shipped). Chosen over Valhalla (no maintained
    Android map-matching binding) / BRouter
    (no street names) / Mapbox (token-gated). It's wired as a `:core` dep
    (`libs.graphhopper.mapmatching`, **OSM-import deps excluded** - osmosis/protobuf/woodstox/
    xmlgraphics are Android-hostile + only needed to *build* graphs, which we do off-device).
  - **Three ART workarounds, all in `GraphHopperRouteEngine` - don't remove:** (1)
    **`graph.dataaccess=MMAP`** (default RAMDataAccess static-inits a JDK-16 `VarHandle` method ART
    lacks); (2) **override `createWeightingFactory()`** to a hand-rolled `SpeedWeighting`+access-block
    (v11 compiles custom models via **Janino** → JVM bytecode ART can't load); (3) **swallow `close()`**
    (MMAP unmap uses `Unsafe.invokeCleaner`, absent on Android - keep one engine for the process
    lifetime).
  - **Three MORE pre-API-34 workarounds (2026-07-17, fork-only - upstream has none and is silently
    broken on every device below Android 14; all three are upstream-worthy). Offline routing had NEVER
    worked on this fork's target phones (API 26-33) until these:**
    (4) **the car custom model is built PROGRAMMATICALLY** (`carModel()`), never via
    `GHUtility.loadCustomModelFromJar` - Jackson bean-introspects `Statement`, a Java 17 RECORD, and
    the record probe needs `Class.getRecordComponents` (ART API 34+); record CONSTRUCTORS are fine.
    Keep `carModel()` in lockstep with the jar's bundled `custom_models/car.json` (content must match
    or the baked per-profile version hashes in `properties` reject the graph).
    (5) **profiles are set via `hopper.setProfiles` + `chPreparationHandler.setCHProfiles` AFTER
    `init(cfg)`, never inside the config** - `GraphHopper.init` force-round-trips every profile's
    custom model through Jackson (`writeValueAsBytes` + `readValue`, GraphHopper.java ~1631), hitting
    the same record probe.
    (6) **a Gradle artifact transform patches `graphhopper-core-*.jar`**
    (`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/GraphHopperByteBufferPatch.kt`, registered in `app/build.gradle.kts`):
    MMapDataAccess reads/writes graph segments with the JDK-13 absolute-bulk
    `ByteBuffer.get/put(int, byte[], int, int)` (ART API 34+); the transform rewrites those six call
    sites - the only ones in the whole dependency tree, verified by constant-pool scan - to
    `app.vela.core.util.ByteBufferCompat` (`duplicate()+position()`, byte-identical semantics).
    buildSrc deliberately has NO AGP dependency (AGP there splits plugin classloaders and breaks the
    root plugins block - the reason this is an artifact transform, not AGP ASM instrumentation).
    Device-proven end-to-end on API 33: v2 graph download → load → offline route with street names.
  - **R8:** `consumer-rules.pro` keeps `com.graphhopper.**` + hppc/jts/jackson wholesale (GraphHopper
    resolves a lot reflectively) and `-dontwarn`s the excluded/absent refs - release build is clean
    (**but +~10 MB APK; tighter keeps / on-demand delivery is a later optimisation**).
  - Graphs are built off-device, one per region, and (Phase 1b) downloaded alongside the offline tiles;
    `RouteEngine` is selected by connectivity + graph-presence.
  - **Speed needs Contraction Hierarchies:** plain flexible A* with the interpreted `SpeedWeighting` was
    **7.6 s** for a 24-mi trip on a Pixel 5a; **CH prepared on the SAME `SpeedWeighting`** (the engine
    declares `setCHProfiles`, `tools/graphbuilder` builds it) → **188 ms**. Graphs MUST be built with CH
    on that weighting (CH bakes the build-time weighting), to **internal** storage (FUSE external was
    I/O-bound).
  - **`SpeedWeighting` ETA gotcha:** it reports time as `distance_m/speed` as if `car_average_speed`
    (km/h) were m/s - 3.6× too fast - so the engine AND `graphbuilder` override `calcEdgeMillis` to
    `distance_m·3600/kmh`; keep them identical.
  - **Encoded values = `car_access, car_average_speed, road_access, max_speed`** - the string is
    byte-identical in `GraphBuilder.java` and `GraphHopperRouteEngine.kt` (a mismatch fails graph load);
    keep it so. `max_speed` is the OSM `maxspeed` posted limit (km/h), a **passive stored column**
    (`OSMMaxSpeedParser` auto-registers; NOT in the weighting/CH, so it doesn't change routes) read by
    the speed-limit badge via `GraphHopperRouteEngine.currentRoadLimit(lat,lng)` - a `LocationIndex`
    snap + `EdgeIteratorState.get` off the **base graph** (CH-safe).
  - **Adding/removing an encoded value is a BREAKING graph-format change**: old graphs lack the EV and
    `getDecimalEncodedValue` THROWS - `currentRoadLimit` swallows it (badge hidden, no crash), but to
    actually light the badge up you must **re-bake + re-host every region graph** via
    `routing-graphs.yml`. Existing installs keep their old graphs until re-downloaded (no
    version-discriminator yet - a manifest `schema` bump so they auto-update is a follow-up).
  - **Status: DONE, graphs HOSTED + multi-region.** `RoutingGraphStore` (`:app`) downloads region CH
    graphs from a manifest (`BuildConfig.ROUTING_MANIFEST_URL`, override `-ProutingManifestUrl=` for
    local testing) into `filesDir/graphs/<id>/`, merging each into `filesDir/graphs/index.json`
    (`[{id,bbox:[S,W,N,E]}]`); `GraphHopperRouteEngine` lazy-loads a `GraphHopper` per region and routes
    a trip on the **smallest region whose bbox covers BOTH endpoints**, falling through to the
    next-smallest if that graph can't make the trip (`inBox`, unit-tested). Smallest-first because
    Geofabrik extract boxes carry a buffer that spills across borders; the same rule drives the picker's
    "covers your location" label + the tiles→routing combine, so all three agree.
  - Settings → **Offline** (one section: a **Map area** subhead = viewport tile download, and a
    **Routing regions** subhead = the picker) is a location-aware picker (regions covering the GPS fix
    sort first + flag "covers your location"; a name filter appears once the catalog is large);
    downloading offline map *tiles* for an area ALSO pulls that area's routing region
    (`MapViewModel.downloadRoutingForArea`). `directions()` uses the engine when OSRM is empty. A trip
    must fit ONE region's monolithic graph (cross-region → online).
  - **Hosting + world catalog:** graphs + `routing-manifest.json` are assets on the **`routing-graphs`
    GitHub release** (fixed-tag prerelease, never the "Latest" the APK tracks). The catalog is
    **`tools/routing-regions.json`** (135 regions, grouped by continent; `big:true` = country-sized). CI
    **`.github/workflows/routing-graphs.yml`** is a **race-safe matrix**: `prep` (group/ids → matrix) →
    parallel `build` (each region: `graphbuilder` CH graph → upload its own `<id>.zip` + emit a manifest
    *entry* artifact, via `scripts/build-routing-region.sh MANIFEST_MODE=emit`) → one `merge`
    (`scripts/merge-routing-manifest.sh` folds all entries into the manifest in a single replace-by-id
    upload; a `concurrency: routing-graphs-manifest` guard also serializes whole runs so back-to-back
    dispatches queue instead of racing two merge jobs).
  - **bbox MUST come from `osmium -g header.boxes`** (declared extract region) - `data.bbox` (node
    extent) is polluted by outlier nodes and made Oregon falsely cover WA.
  - Build one region locally: `scripts/build-routing-region.sh <id> "<name>" <pbf-url>` (all-in-one), or
    the graph alone: `./gradlew :tools:graphbuilder:run --args="region.osm.pbf out-dir"`. Local manifest
    test: serve a manifest+graph, `adb reverse tcp:8099 tcp:8099`, build with
    `-ProutingManifestUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8099/manifest.json` (localhost cleartext allowed by
    `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`; all other traffic stays HTTPS).
- **Offline PLACE packs - whole-region POI/address search, Organic-Maps-style (`app/offline/PoiPackStore` +
  `core/data/OfflinePacks`).**
  - Downloading a state (routing region) also pulls its place pack - a per-region SQLite db baked by CI
    from the SAME Geofabrik PBF (`scripts/build-poi-region.sh`: osmium tags-filter → export geojsonseq →
    `poipack_build.py` → SQLite → zip; workflow `poi-packs.yml`, a matrix clone of routing-graphs.yml
    with `merge-poi-manifest.sh`; release tag `poi-packs`, manifest `poi-pack-manifest.json`,
    `POI_PACK_MANIFEST_URL` / `-PpoiPackManifestUrl=`).
  - **Pack schema is NORMALIZED, not the app stores' own schema** (that naive shape was 761 MB for WA):
    `poi(id,name,lat,lng,category,address,phone,website,hours)` + `streetname(sid,street,street_norm)` +
    `addr(hn,sid,city,lat,lng)` + `streetpt(sid,lat,lng)` → WA = 335 MB raw / **143 MB zipped** (163k
    POIs, 2.8M addrs, 1.2M street pts, 92k street names).
  - The normalization is also the QUERY strategy: match street names first (~90k-row scan), hit the big
    tables only through sid/hn/lat indexes - never a LIKE scan of millions of rows.
  - `OfflinePacks` (:core singleton) holds the opened read-only dbs; `OfflinePoiStore.search` runs its
    same SQL on each pack (identical poi columns), `OfflineAddressStore` has dedicated pack paths
    (`packSids`/`packQuery`/`packStreetGeom` + reverse-geocode JOINs) merged into query()/streetGeom()/
    reverseGeocode(); counts include packs. `poipack_build.py` PORTS `normalizeStreet`'s ABBREV and
    OverpassPois' category formatting - keep them in sync.
  - Lifecycle: pack downloads after its region's graph (`downloadPoiPack`), deletes with it
    (`deleteRoutingGraph`), `registerPacks()` at VM init; graphs installed before packs get a **"Get
    places"** button on the Settings row (`downloadPoiPackFor`, with a "no pack published yet" status
    when the manifest lacks the region).
  - **Heads-up progress:** `RegionDownloadCard` in MapScreen mirrors the voice card
    (`routingDownloadingId`/`routingDownloadPct` then `poiPackDownloadingId`/`poiPackDownloadPct`, named
    by `regionDownloadName`).
  - Local pack test: build one with the script's osmium+python steps, serve manifest+zip on :8099,
    `adb reverse`, `-PpoiPackManifestUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8099/poi-pack-manifest.json`. **After pushing,
    dispatch Actions → "Build offline place packs"** (group=us etc.) to publish packs + manifest.
  - **Pack freshness: rev + monthly cron + row-level deltas.** Manifest rows carry
    `rev`/`updatedAt`/`counts{poi,addr,streetpt,streetname}` and optionally `delta{fromRev,url,sizeMb}`;
    `poi-packs.yml` has a monthly `schedule` cron (3rd, 07:15 UTC) whose prep step selects ALL catalog
    regions. `build-poi-region.sh` reads the LIVE manifest for the old rev, downloads the previous zip
    BEFORE clobbering it, builds the delta (`scripts/poipack_delta.py`, SQL EXCEPT per table into del_/
    ins_ tables), and publishes it only when it is under half the full size.
  - App: installed revs in `poipacks/revs.json` (`PoiPackStore.installedRev`); Settings shows "Update
    available" + an **Update places** button when the manifest rev is newer;
    `MapViewModel.downloadPoiPack(update=true)` applies the delta via `PoiPackStore.applyDelta` ONLY when
    installedRev == deltaFromRev, else full download. applyDelta runs one transaction (delete-by-full-row
    via a rowid JOIN with NULL-safe `IS` matching, then insert), verifies every table count against the
    manifest before committing, and re-registers packs on both success and failure.
  - **sids are STABLE content hashes** - SHA-1 of `street_norm` truncated to a positive 63-bit int,
    collision fails the build; NEVER a counter (a counter renumbers millions of rows on one mid-order
    insertion and the delta balloons to pack size).
  - `TABLE_COLUMNS` in PoiPackStore mirrors `poipack_build.py` + `poipack_delta.py` - keep all three in
    sync (`PRAGMA user_version=2`). Gotcha: KDoc in PoiPackStore must not contain a literal `del_*/ins_*`
    (the `*/` ends the comment).
  - `OfflinePoiStore.search` orders whole-query name matches first so they survive the internal 400-row
    cap. v1-format packs (published before rev existed) have no rev; their first v2 rebuild yields no
    usable delta so clients just full-download once, then deltas kick in.
- **Offline forward geocoder - typed address → coordinate, no signal (`core/data/OfflineAddressStore` +
  `OverpassPois.fetchAddresses`/`fetchStreets`).**
  - So an arbitrary typed street address routes offline (not only addresses that are an indexed POI).
    Populated when a map area is downloaded (`MapViewModel.downloadOfflinePois`) from keyless Overpass
    over a bbox **padded to a ~15 km min span around the viewport centre** (`GEOCODE_PAD_DEG=0.09`, so a
    saved area covers the surrounding metro, not just the on-screen tiles).
  - TWO OSM sources into ONE SQLite db (`vela_offline_addr.db`, v2): **`addr:housenumber` points**
    (`addr` table) for house-precise hits, and **named road centrelines** (`street` table, thinned to
    ~1 pt/120 m by `toStreetPts`) for a street-level fallback where OSM has the road but no house numbers
    (the US-suburb reality; the OpenAddresses/Microsoft *render* overlays are PMTiles, not queryable as a
    geocoder, so the geocoder uses OSM).
  - `geocode()` is layered: (1) exact house number, (2) **interpolate** between the two bracketing mapped
    numbers, (3) nearest mapped house on the street, (4) nearest point on the street centreline.
    `normalizeStreet` expands abbreviations both ways ("Pl"↔"place", "SE"↔"southeast") so all spellings
    hit the same rows.
  - Wired into the offline search branch (`MapViewModel`, gated by `OfflineAddressStore.looksLikeAddress`
    so "coffee" doesn't hit it) AND the network-error fallback; `haveArea` counts `count()`+
    `streetCount()` so a street-only suburb isn't misreported "no data". Big Overpass bodies → the
    no-call-timeout `offlineDownloadHttp` (same rule as the graph/overlay downloads). The result Place
    routes through the normal GraphHopper offline engine.
  - **Reverse-geocode backfill for offline POIs:** most US chains have no OSM `addr:*` (Applebee's comes
    back as bare "WA"), so `MapViewModel.backfillOfflineAddress` - on selecting a place while offline,
    when its address has no house number (`.none { isDigit() }`) - calls
    `OfflineAddressStore.reverseGeocode(loc)` (nearest mapped house ≤60 m, else nearest street ≤150 m,
    bounded lat/lng box scan) and fills `selected.address` if still selected.
  - **Quiet offline indicator (no banner):** `MapUiState.offline` (a reactive `ConnectivityManager`
    default-network callback, `observeConnectivity`, fails safe to online) drives a greyed globe-slash +
    "Offline" in `SearchBar` (bare map only) and a globe-slash chip **inline under the category chips**
    in `MapScreen`'s top Column (gated to the same bare-map state the chips show in, so it never trails a
    results list).
  - **The directions ETA subtitle** (`PlaceSheet.DepartTimeChooser`) only says "current traffic" when
    `route.hasLiveTraffic`; an offline (traffic-less) route shows the arrival time with no traffic note.
  - **Upgrade nudge:** the address index is built at download time, so areas saved before the geocoder
    have tiles+POIs but no addresses. Settings → Offline shows a "Update saved areas" card when
    `regions.isNotEmpty() && offlineAddressCount == 0` (via `MapViewModel.offlineAddressCount`); tapping
    it runs `refreshOfflineDataForSavedAreas` - iterates every saved `OfflineRegion`, reads its
    `OfflineMaps.boundsOf` and re-runs `downloadOfflinePois` over each box.
- **Open building-footprint overlay (`app/offline/OverlayTileStore` + `VelaMapView`).**
  - Fills the map's building gaps where OSM is thin (a suburb the Microsoft→OSM import never reached)
    with **Microsoft US Building Footprints (ODbL)**.
  - Off-device, CI bakes ONE `.pmtiles` per US state (`scripts/build-overlay-region.sh` → tippecanoe
    `-l building -Z14 -z16 --drop-densest-as-needed`; `-Z14` not `-Z12` - starting at z12 ballooned WA
    to 271 MB, z14 → 197 MB) → `building-overlays` GitHub release + `building-overlay-manifest.json`,
    matrix workflow `.github/workflows/building-overlays.yml` (clone of the routing one,
    `MANIFEST_MODE=emit` + `scripts/merge-overlay-manifest.sh`), catalog `tools/overlay-regions.json`.
  - In-app: `OverlayTileStore` is a single-file sibling of `RoutingGraphStore` (`filesDir/overlays/
    <id>.pmtiles` + `index.json`; PMTiles-magic guard).
  - **The overlay STREAMS online - no download needed to see houses.** `refreshBuildingOverlays` runs on
    every camera-idle (`onViewport`) and emits, per view, a list of full `pmtiles://` URIs: a
    **`pmtiles://file://<abs-path>`** for any DOWNLOADED region (offline), and
    **`pmtiles://https://…<region>.pmtiles`** for the covering regions in view that AREN'T downloaded -
    the **UNION of up to the 3 smallest covering boxes, NOT just the single smallest**: a neighbour's
    rectangular bbox can spill across an irregular border AND be smaller (Kansas's box crosses the
    Missouri River and beats Missouri's box, but kansas.pmtiles is EMPTY east of the river, so a
    single-pick rendered NO footprints there). Streaming the union lets whichever archive has the data
    paint; an empty region's range requests cost ~nothing.
  - MapLibre 11.7+ reads that hosted archive by **HTTP range requests** (GitHub release assets
    302→release-assets host with `accept-ranges: bytes`, MapLibre follows the redirect), fetching only
    the visible tiles, so footprints appear as you pan. The manual **`MapViewModel.downloadOverlayForArea`**
    (still smallest-covering-box, pulled alongside the area's tiles) is now ONLY for going fully offline.
  - Render: `VelaMapView`'s `LaunchedEffect(buildingOverlays, styleRef, darkTheme)` adds each URI as a
    `VectorSource` (used verbatim - the URI already carries `pmtiles://file://` or `pmtiles://https://`)
    + a `FillLayer` `setSourceLayer("building")` **`addLayerBelow` the OSM `building` layer**, themed to
    the exact OSM building fill/outline (`#323f54`/`#3f4e66` dark, `#dde1e7`/`#c4c9d1` light) so overlay
    footprints are indistinguishable from real OSM ones and OSM still wins wherever it has data.
    `buildingOverlays` is de-duped so panning within one region doesn't churn the map sources.
  - **The load-bearing DOWNLOAD bug was NOT the render** - it was the `callTimeout(0)` rule above: the
    197 MB body aborted at the shared client's 12 s cap, silently (that only ever mattered for the
    offline download; streaming reads a few KB/tile). NB GitHub release hosting works but isn't a CDN - a
    real deployment should host the PMTiles behind a CDN for snappier range reads.
  - `OVERLAY_MANIFEST_URL` BuildConfig overridable `-PoverlayManifestUrl=` like routing. BREAKING-ish: an
    overlay is DATA (ODbL), orthogonal to the app's GPLv3, obligation met by tippecanoe `--attribution` +
    the release publishing derived tiles under ODbL.
  - **World catalog (`tools/overlay-regions.json`, 361 rows - ~250 base regions plus chunk pieces):** TWO
    Microsoft sources picked by each row's `source`, both handled by the ONE build script (`SOURCE` env):
    **`us-legacy`** = a US state's single `.geojson.zip` (Microsoft US Building Footprints, 51 states+DC);
    **`ms-global`** = a world country's quadkey-partitioned GeoJSONL from Microsoft's **Global ML Building
    Footprints** (`global-buildings/dataset-links.csv` → `awk` the country's `Location` rows → curl+gunzip
    each `.csv.gz` into one ndjson → tippecanoe `-P`; ~199 countries). Country **bboxes are the union of
    the dataset's own z9 quadkey tiles**; US-state bboxes are Geofabrik extract bounds.
  - **Big countries are CHUNKED** (>1500 MB compressed source, 18 of them): the catalog splits each into
    sub-national pieces by **quadkey PREFIX** (`qkprefix`; adaptive recursive split until each chunk ≤
    ~1500 MB - India → 24 pieces), the build script's awk filters the country's rows to that prefix, and
    each chunk gets its own union bbox so the **app's smallest-covering-box rule picks the piece covering
    the user** (fits CI disk + hosts under GitHub's 2 GB/asset limit). Only the whole-US aggregate +
    continental aggregates + duplicate Locations (CzechRepublic→Czechia, DemocraticRepublicoftheCongo→
    CongoDRC) are dropped.
  - The catalog is 361 regions - **over GitHub's 256-job matrix cap** - so each row carries a `group`
    (`us` / `world` / `chunk`) and dispatch is **one group at a time** (`-f group=world`); run-level
    concurrency is OFF so groups build concurrently, only the merge job serialises. The app/manifest are
    source-AGNOSTIC - the emitted manifest row is always `{id,name,url(asset),sizeMb,bbox}`.
- **Open house-number overlay (`VelaMapView` + `scripts/build-address-region.sh`).**
  - Microsoft footprints have geometry but **no addresses**, so house numbers come from a SECOND overlay:
    **OpenAddresses** address POINTS → per-state `.pmtiles` (`-l address`, keep the `number` prop) →
    `address-overlays` GitHub release + `address-overlay-manifest.json` (`ADDRESS_MANIFEST_URL`,
    `-PaddressManifestUrl=`).
  - Data source = OpenAddresses batch API: `/api/data?source=us/<st>/statewide&layer=addresses` → its
    current `job` → `https://v2.openaddresses.io/batch-prod/job/<job>/source.geojson.gz` (GeoJSONL of
    Points with `number`/`street`; **42 US states have a `statewide` source**).
  - Render: `VelaMapView`'s `LaunchedEffect(addressOverlays, …)` adds a `VectorSource` (the URI) + a
    **`SymbolLayer`** `setSourceLayer("address")`, `textField(get("number"))`, `textFont(["Noto Sans
    Regular"])`, size 10, grey + white halo, **minZoom 19** (in lockstep with the basemap
    `vela-housenumber` layer - numbers only at the ~50 ft scale, raised from 17.5 on 2026-07-13) - inserted
    below `vela-controls` (see the LAYER ORDER warning below).
  - **Streams online exactly like buildings** (`MapViewModel.refreshAddressOverlays(center)` on every
    camera-idle → the union of up to the 3 smallest covering regions' `pmtiles://https://…` URIs - same
    spilled-bbox shadowing fix as the building overlay, see above; reuses `overlayStore.manifest()` which
    is manifest-URL-agnostic).
  - **LAYER ORDER:** the addr layers are inserted **BELOW `vela-controls`** (→ below the ambient POI
    icons), NOT `addLayer`/top - MapLibre places symbols TOPMOST-FIRST, so numbers stacked above the
    ambient layer grab collision boxes before the business icons place and **EVICT them at z16+** (the
    "Applebee's icon disappears on zoom-in" bug: big prominence-scaled icons collide the most). Below the
    icons, numbers place last and yield - Google's behaviour. Also: while the overlay is active the
    basemap `vela-housenumber` layer is hidden (visibility NONE in the same LaunchedEffect) - both drew
    the SAME address at a slight offset.
  - **NOT** the building overlay (different data + a Symbol not Fill layer + its own release/manifest).
    CI: `.github/workflows/address-overlays.yml` (clone of building-overlays), catalog
    `tools/address-regions.json`.
  - **The house numbers fill the exact gap the basemap `vela-housenumber` (OSM `addr:housenumber`) leaves
    in new suburbs.**
- **Ambient POI label density + collision priority (upstream c35eea33 + bd165ba0).** The ambient icon
  layer's `sort` (collision priority) is PROMINENCE-based, never the list index - an index key changes
  every place's priority whenever the pool re-ranks and the whole layer's placement reshuffles.
  `(10 - prominence) * 1000 + i`. Labels tier by zoom x prominence through the `textField` step
  expression (below z15.5 only prominence>=6 ~ 400+ reviews; z15.5+ >=5 ~ 120+; z16.5+ >=3 ~ 20+;
  z17.5+ everything) - an EMPTY textField skips label placement entirely (a textOpacity of 0 would
  still place and collide it, paying the cost invisibly). Guarding both: `nearbyPlaces`'s SLIM-FLAVOR
  HEAL - a fresh session's first ~3 s serves rating-but-no-review-count places, which zeroes
  `ambientProminence` and flattens ranking/sizing/tiers; a majority-slim pool refetches once.
- **Traffic lights + stop signs drawn on the map (`OverpassTrafficSignals.fetchControlsInBox` + `VelaMapView`).**
  - OSM `highway=traffic_signals` (a stoplight icon) and `highway=stop` (a red STOP octagon) as a
    non-interactive `SymbolLayer` (`vela-controls`, icons `vela-signal`/`vela-stop`) drawn **beneath**
    the POI dots + pins, `minZoom 16`.
  - **Icon sizing/visibility:** `iconSize` is a zoom-interpolated expression (~0.75 at z15.5 → 1.05 at
    z17 → 1.5 at z19) - the flat 0.55 was too small to spot, especially tilted in nav; and
    `iconAllowOverlap(true)`+`iconIgnorePlacement(true)` so they ALWAYS draw (controls are sparse - one
    per junction - and the earlier collision-off-below-POIs was culling them away on the browse map, so
    the user couldn't see them; Google shows all of them at street zoom).
  - Data is keyless Overpass (sibling of the `fetchAlong` nav-landmark fetch + `OverpassPois`), fetched
    by `MapViewModel.refreshTrafficControls` from `onViewport` **only at z ≥ `CONTROLS_MIN_ZOOM` (16)**.
    Controls are STATIC, so it fetches a box padded 50% beyond the viewport and **reuses it while the
    center stays in the inner half** (`controlsBox`) - panning/driving through an area triggers no
    refetch; only nearing the box edge refetches (single-flight + 350 ms settle).
  - The layer/updater are identity-gated like markers/ambient (`lastAppliedControls`) so a nav speedo
    tick doesn't re-tessellate them. No app setting (zoom-gated); no PMTiles/CI (live Overpass). NB the
    `TRAFFIC_*` constants in `VelaMapView` are a DIFFERENT thing - Google's live-traffic raster overlay;
    the controls use `CONTROLS_*`.
- **Public transit uses the same hidden WebView** (`app/web/WebDirectionsFetcher`).
  - A plain `/maps/preview/directions` GET with the transit flag (`!3e3`) is silently downgraded to a
    *driving* reply (same TLS-fingerprint bot-detection as photos), so the WebView instead navigates the
    `/maps/dir/<olat>,<olng>/<dlat>,<dlng>/data=!4m2!4m1!3e3` page and reads the itinerary set out of
    `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE`.
  - **Depart/arrive time:** the board is time-dependent, so a scheduled request replaces the plain
    `!4m2!4m1!3e3` with Google's time block - `!4m6!4m5!2m3!6e{0=depart,1=arrive,2=last}!7e2!8j<unix-seconds>!3e3`
    (the `!4m` numbers are DESCENDANT counts, so the inner group grows `4m1`→`4m5` and the outer
    `4m2`→`4m6`; verified against a real Google transit-with-time URL - an earlier `!4m8!4m7` guess had
    the wrong counts and Google silently fell back to "now").
  - **Gotchas:** the directions payload is the **longest** `)]}'`-guarded string under slot `[3]` (a
    ~1.7 KB stub sits alongside the ~165 KB real one - take the longest, and poll for it: the SPA fills
    it a beat after page-finish).
  - `TransitParser` (`:core`, takes the raw string so `:app` stays out of kotlinx.serialization, like
    `PhotosParser`) reads `root[0][1]` = trips, each trip's **summary at `trip[0]`**; `trip[1][0][1]` is
    the per-stop leg tree. Calibrated + device-verified Davis→Sacramento.
  - **Full stop detail (unit-tested):** a RIDE leg carries its stop block at **`leg[5]`** - board
    `[5][0]`, alight `[5][1]`, **stop count `[5][2]`**, intermediate list `[5][7]` (each stop node: name
    `[0]`, agency code `[1]`, and time tuples - real-time arr/dep at `[2]`/`[3]`, timetable at `[7]`/
    `[8]`, so RT-vs-timetable epochs give "N min late"); **headsign `leg[0][14][2][1][0]`**, agency phone
    `leg[0][6][4][0][4]`, service alerts `leg[0][9][k][2]`. Fare is scanned defensively from the trip
    summary (usually absent). NB `parseLines` allows a **1-char** line name (single-digit bus routes like
    "9" are real).
  - Each stop node's **coordinates are `[4][2]` (lat) / `[4][3]` (lng)** - `parseStopTime` reads them
    into `TransitStopTime.location`, and `assignWalkEndpoints` wires each WALK leg's `walkFrom`/`walkTo`
    from the adjacent ride's alight/board stop (falling back to the trip origin/dest, which `parse(raw,
    origin, dest)` threads through). The UI then fetches that walk leg's turn-by-turn steps **on demand**
    via the normal walk router (`MapViewModel.walkDirections` → OSRM foot) - no extra transit RPC.
  - **Step-by-step transit guidance** (Moovit-style, `TransitNavState` + `startTransitNav`/`advance`/
    `back`/`endTransitNav` in `MapViewModel`, `TransitNavSheet` in `PlaceSheet`) walks the itinerary leg
    by leg, speaking each cue (`transitStepSpoken` → the `transit_nav_*` strings) and auto-advancing when
    GPS reaches the leg end. The auto-advance is **latched** (`maybeAdvanceTransitNav`,
    `TRANSIT_ARM_M=90`/`TRANSIT_ARRIVE_M=40`): a leg only advances once it's been ARMED by being >ARM_M
    from its end, so a transfer hub can't cascade through legs and a short final walk can't fire a
    premature arrival.
