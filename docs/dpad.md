# D-pad-only operation (no touchscreen required)

Vela is fully drivable with a **5-key D-pad** (↑ ↓ ← → + OK) plus BACK. Touch is a
bonus, not a requirement. This document is the authoritative record of the design, the
rules, and how to keep the work easy to merge with upstream.

## Why this is mostly free in Compose - and where it isn't

**Finding 1: Compose gives D-pad focus traversal for free on anything `clickable`.**
Every `Modifier.clickable`, Material button, chip, switch, checkbox, dialog button and
dropdown item is already a focus target: arrows move focus spatially, OK activates.
Roughly 90% of Vela's UI needed **no operability work** - only focus *visibility* work.

**Finding 2: five things were genuinely touch-only.** The real gaps:

1. **The map itself** - pan/zoom/tap/long-press are all gestures on the MapLibre view.
2. **The search overlay's focus semantics** - two traps (below).
3. **Sheet handles** - the place sheet's expand/collapse handle was a `detectTapGestures`
   + drag detector (no focus target, no key activation).
   - The results list and directions panel already had button/`clickable` alternatives.
4. **The nav maneuver banner** - stepping through upcoming turns was swipe-only.
5. **The full-screen photo viewer** - paging was swipe-only.

**Finding 3: focus visibility is the other half.** Material's default focus indication
(a faint ripple state layer) is too subtle on Vela's fixed-grey sheets. Without an obvious
ring you can't tell where you are - technically operable but practically unusable.

## Design

### Core helpers - `app/ui/DpadFocus.kt` (new file)

- `rememberDpadFirstDevice()` - the D-pad is a PRIMARY input, so default to a D-pad-first
  UI (affordances shown persistently, initial focus/engage placed for the user). Detection
  is deliberately **conservative** - do NOT loosen it:
  - **`FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN`** - genuinely touchless (Android TV / a real no-touch keypad) is
    the one unambiguous signal. Feature phones lie about it (the MTK panel reports
    `touchscreen=finger`), so it only ever produces a true-negative, never a false-positive.
  - **A PHYSICAL `InputDevice` with `SOURCE_DPAD`** - a game controller, remote, or a keypad
    whose own hardware exposes the D-pad.
  - **Do NOT count the framework's Virtual aggregate device (id −1).** It reports
    `KEYBOARD | DPAD` on essentially EVERY Android phone (confirmed on a Pixel 9 via
    `dumpsys input`). Counting it classifies ordinary phones as keypad devices and breaks
    the search bar - a plain tap stops opening the field / raising the keyboard, and the
    `+`/`−` zoom buttons appear on a touch phone.
  - **`KeyCharacterMap.deviceHasKey(DPAD_CENTER)` is dropped** - true on a Pixel too (the
    virtual keymap carries the key) and already false on the MTK phone, so it only added
    false positives.
  - A fake-touchscreen keypad phone therefore isn't detected as D-pad-*first*; it still gets
    full D-pad operation REACTIVELY the moment a key is pressed (via `rememberDpadMode`), just
    without pre-placed focus on the very first frame. That is the price of never breaking
    touch, since no startup signal separates such a phone from a Pixel.
- `rememberDpadMode()` - `dpadFirst || inputMode == Keyboard`.
  - True on a D-pad-first device, and on any other device the instant Compose sees a non-touch
    key event (affordances appear on the first key press, melt away on the next tap).
  - This carries hybrid/keypad phones now that `dpadFirst` no longer trusts the virtual device.
- `Modifier.dpadHighlight(shape)` - a 2 dp primary-colour focus ring.
  - Drawn only while the element (or a descendant - Material buttons host their own focus node,
    and `onFocusEvent.hasFocus` covers both) holds focus **and** the UI is key-driven.
  - Honours `dpadFirst` directly, since a D-pad-first phone may still read `inputMode == Touch`
    until the first key event. Never appears under touch.
- `rememberDpadAutoFocus(vararg keys)` - **D-pad-FIRST initial focus.**
  - Returns a `FocusRequester`; attach it to a screen's primary element via
    `Modifier.focusRequester(...)` and focus is placed there the moment the screen/overlay
    appears - so the user never has to press a key just to *wake up* focus (see "Initial focus"
    below).
  - Retries 20 × 50 ms because a freshly-composed focus node usually isn't attached on frame 1
    (the first `requestFocus()` throws and nothing ends up focused).
  - Only requests on a D-pad-first device, so touch UX is byte-identical.
  - Its sibling `Modifier.dpadAutoFocus()` does the same but keeps re-requesting **until
    `onFocusEvent` confirms focus actually landed** (not just "requestFocus didn't throw") - use
    it when the target may be off-screen; see Known limitations.
- `Modifier.dpadFieldEscape()` - makes a text field **escapable** by D-pad: UP/DOWN move
  focus to the previous/next form control instead of being swallowed by the field's own
  cursor handling.
  - A single- or multi-line `TextField`/`BasicTextField` otherwise eats the vertical arrows,
    **trapping focus on the field so nothing below it is reachable**.
  - Fires via `onPreviewKeyEvent` (root→leaf) so it wins before the field consumes the key, and
    swallows the matching key-up so the field never sees a half event.
  - Returns false at a list edge where focus can't move, so the field still behaves normally
    there. Inert under touch (gated on `rememberDpadMode`).
  - Apply to any text field sitting in a vertical list of focusable controls. (The search bar's
    field solves the same trap inline - see Trap C - because it also needs the BACK/close
    handling in the same key handler.)

### The MapLibre `MapView` steals D-pad keys - the load-bearing fix

**Finding 0 (the reason "nothing happened"):** MapLibre's `MapView` calls `requestFocus()`
on itself and overrides `onKeyDown` for hardware keys (`DPAD_CENTER` = zoom in, arrows =
scroll).

- On a keypad phone it therefore grabs focus and **swallows every D-pad key before Compose
  focus ever sees it** - arrows do nothing visible, OK zooms the map, no Compose focus ring
  appears.
- Fix (`VelaMapView.kt`): make the `MapView` and its descendants **non-focusable**
  (`isFocusable = false`, `descendantFocusability = FOCUS_BLOCK_DESCENDANTS`), unconditionally
  and re-asserted in the `AndroidView` update block (MapLibre re-enables it on surface
  recreation).
- Touch gestures don't need view focus, so nothing is lost; keys now flow to the Compose focus
  system and `MapDpadController` drives the map instead.

### The map - `MapDpadController` (new file) + a focusable centre target

`app/ui/map/MapDpadController.kt` is the key→camera seam. `VelaMapView` wires it up in
`getMapAsync` alongside the touch listeners; MapScreen owns the key handling. The
controller deliberately **reuses the exact same code paths as touch**:

- `selectAtCenter()` calls the *same* tap-resolution lambda the click listener uses
  (search-result pins → ambient POI dots → alternate-route lines → basemap POIs →
  unnamed-POI reverse geocode).
  - The touch listener body was only *named* (`handleTap`), not moved or reindented, so
    upstream edits to it merge cleanly.
- `longPressAtCenter()` → the same `onMapLongPress` path (drop pin / set a
  Choose-on-map point).
- `panBy()` sets the same `gestureMove` flag a drag sets (so "Search this area" and
  camera-idle viewport updates fire) and detaches the nav follow-camera exactly like a
  finger pan.
- `zoomBy()` during nav adopts the manual nav-zoom override exactly like a pinch
  (`navUserZoom`); in browse it counts as a user gesture.

**MapScreen's map target**: a 140 dp focusable box at the screen centre, with a
**two-stage** model:

- **Focused** (pill: "OK: move the map"): a *normal* focus stop. Arrows keep
  traversing the chrome - search bar, chips, zoom buttons, FABs, sheets all stay
  reachable. OK **engages** map control.
- **Engaged** (crosshair + screen-edge ring):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ↑ ↓ ← → | pan by 22% of the view (auto-repeats when held) |
| OK (short) | "tap" whatever is under the crosshair; in Choose-on-map mode, confirm the pick |
| OK (held ≥ 500 ms) | long-press at the crosshair (drop pin / set pick directly) |
| +/− or zoom keys | zoom (bonus for devices that have them) |
| BACK | **disengage** - focus stays on the target, arrows traverse the chrome again |

> **Don't regress the two-stage model:** a single stage (the map consuming all four arrows
> whenever it merely *holds focus*, BACK clearing focus to nowhere) leaves no way to grab the
> search bar - Compose's focus restoration puts the next key press right back on the map. A
> focusable that consumes arrows must always be a mode you *enter* (via OK), and leaving it
> must never clear focus.

Long-press detection uses the native key event's `repeatCount`/`eventTime − downTime`
(≥ 500 ms while held), so the pin drops *while holding*, like touch.

**Panel-aware:** the map target is shown/focusable ONLY when the map is the primary surface.

- With a list/sheet/panel/search open (`mapTargetHidden`), it unmounts so the panel owns focus -
  a centre crosshair + focus stop floating over the results list stole DOWN traversal into the
  rows (DOWN from the results header jumped to the zoom `+` button, never reaching a result).
- Returning to the bare map re-acquires + re-engages it via `LaunchedEffect(dpadFirst,
  mapTargetHidden)` (retries because the focus node may not be attached on the first frame).
- Nav keeps the map primary (the banner is an overlay), so you can still pan during nav.

**Choose-on-map is the one exception.** "Choose on map" (setting a route origin/stop by placing
a pin) opens with `directionsOpen` still true underneath, which `mapTargetHidden` would normally
treat as a panel and unmount the map target.

- But this mode *requires* the map be pannable to position the pin (without the exception arrows
  only moved focus to the cancel **x** and the pin couldn't be moved).
- So `mapTargetHidden` has a leading `state.pickOnMap == null &&` guard: while a pick is in
  progress the map target stays mounted **and auto-engaged**, so arrows pan immediately and OK
  confirms (hold-OK sets it directly).
- The "OK: move the map" focused pill is **suppressed** during a pick (`mapFocused &&
  state.pickOnMap == null`) - there OK *confirms* rather than *enters* map control, so that pill
  would be a lie - and the crosshair/pin + "Move the map to set…" banner come from
  `ChooseOnMapOverlay` instead.

**Zoom buttons**: pinch has no 5-key equivalent, so a D-pad-mode `+`/`−` pair sits mid-right.

- Shown **only while browsing the bare map** (not during search / results / place sheet /
  directions / nav) - mid-right they sit in the vertical focus path of those panels and intercept
  DOWN into their rows.
- Behind a panel the map is covered anyway; zoom it via the engaged crosshair after closing the
  panel.

### Initial focus on every screen (D-pad-first, hard rule)

**Rule: no screen or view may open with nothing focused.** On a D-pad-first device the app is
driven entirely by keys, so a screen that appears un-focused wastes the user's first keypress
just *establishing* focus. Every screen/overlay must land already focused on a sensible element.

Compose does **not** give this for free:

- It only auto-focuses in a few cases, and when a focused element is removed (e.g. a results
  row → the place sheet), focus recovery is *nondeterministic* - it landed sometimes on a photo,
  sometimes on the search bar behind the sheet, sometimes nowhere.
- The fix is `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` attached to each surface's primary element:

| Screen / overlay | Auto-focus target |
|---|---|
| Bare map | **nothing** on open - the map neither auto-focuses nor auto-engages; the user's first arrow lands on the search bar (the first focusable). See note below. |
| **Settings** | back button (top of screen) |
| **Welcome** | Get-started button |
| **Place sheet** | drag handle (else focus leaks to the search bar behind it) |
| **Directions panel** | first travel-mode tab (Drive) |
| **Route steps sheet** | first step row |
| **Reviews WebView** (full-screen) | back arrow (until the WebView loads + grabs focus) |
| Photo gallery | (pre-existing `galleryFocus`) |
| Search overlay | armed search field (arming focuses it) |
| Nav | map stays primary (the banner is an overlay) |

Results after a search keep focus on the search field (Google-style - you can refine or press
DOWN into the list); that's "already focused", so it's left as-is.

**Reproducible verification: [`../tests/dpad/`](../tests/dpad/).** The manual `adb`
focus-dump checks used throughout this doc are scripted there. Run all three after any change that
touches focus (`audit_static.sh` needs no device):
- **`run_all.sh`** - per-surface assertions (bare map → search bar, Settings back button,
  Welcome/dialog auto-focus, place-sheet handle + `VelaMenu`, Choose-on-map engages, Directions
  pill reachable).
- **`audit_static.sh`** - EXHAUSTIVE source scan: every `clickable/toggleable/selectable` has a
  `dpadHighlight` ring, every gesture (`detect*Gestures`/`draggable`/…) has a key path, no bare
  `DropdownMenu`/`AlertDialog`, no `isSystemInDarkTheme`, plus triage notes for bare `.focusable()`
  / raw windows / text fields. Fails the build on any real violation.
- **`audit_dynamic.sh`** - EXHAUSTIVE on-device tour: every surface opens focused, focus is never
  lost across a full DOWN-traversal (a null sample = a dead-end trap), and BACK exits.

**Focus rings on the place sheet.** The place sheet's custom `clickable` content rows need
`dpadHighlight`:

- The rows: Directions/Call/Street-View action pills, route-alternate rows, From/Add-stop/To
  editors, phone/website rows, "also at this location", "people also search for", photo
  thumbnails, hours/transit/popular-times expanders.
- Without it they are focus-reachable but *invisibly* (Material's default state-layer is too
  faint on the fixed-grey sheet).
- They all carry a ring; `audit_static.sh` enforces it. Same for the Settings voice-group
  headers.

**Choose-on-map auto-engages.** The bare map opening un-focused (above) removed the global
auto-engage that Choose-on-map depended on, so pick mode opened dead.

- Restored **scoped to pick mode**: a `LaunchedEffect(pickingOnMap)` in `MapScreen`
  requestFocuses + engages the centre target the moment `state.pickOnMap` goes non-null, so
  arrows pan immediately to place the pin and OK confirms.
- This works (unlike the cold-open bare map) because pick mode is entered mid-session, so focus
  already exists and `requestFocus` lands.

**Settings horizontal-key focus trap.** Settings is a `Column(verticalScroll)`.

- A LEFT/RIGHT press on a plain row (a `SelectableRow`, a switch row - no horizontal neighbour)
  makes Compose's focus search CLEAR focus outright, with no way back via arrows (only BACK
  escapes).
- Root cause: `moveFocus` clears on a no-target directional move in a scrolling column;
  `focusGroup()` doesn't help - only *swallowing* the key keeps focus.
- Fix: the reusable **`Modifier.dpadSwallowHorizontal()`** (`DpadFocus.kt`) on the Settings root
  `Column` AND on the top-bar back button (it lives outside the Column, so it needs it too). It
  fires AFTER a focused child's own handler.
- Any HORIZONTAL row of focusable siblings inside that swallowing Column must drive its OWN
  LEFT/RIGHT, or the swallow strands every sibling but the one DOWN happens to land on (issue #24:
  Import + Test-voice were unreachable on a qin f25). Use the reusable
  **`Modifier.dpadRowSibling(requesters, index)`** (`DpadFocus.kt`) on EACH sibling: it takes that
  index's `FocusRequester` and moves L/R by `requestFocus` (never clears at the ends) while consuming
  the key so it can't reach the root swallow. Applied to the vibrate chips (inline, the original), and
  the Export/Import, Test-voice/System-settings, Speak/Nav-sample and voice speed `-`/`+` &
  speaker `◀`/`▶` button rows, and the Voice-library row's **Use**/**Delete** pair (issue #65: you
  could only reach Delete from above, Use from below). **When you add a button/chip row to a
  vertical-list screen, wire it with `dpadRowSibling` - do not re-inline the pattern.**
- `SelectableRow`'s RadioButton is also `onClick = null` (display-only) so the row is a single
  focus stop. Any new *vertical-list* screen with a lone horizontal row wants the same shape.

**The bare map is the ONE intentional exception.** The map neither auto-focuses nor auto-engages:
nothing is focused on open, and the user's **first arrow lands on the search bar** (Compose's
real-first-key initial focus picks the first focusable).

- Auto-focusing + auto-engaging the centre target on open would pan on the first arrow and force
  a BACK press before the search bar was reachable.
- Why not just pre-focus the search bar? **Compose won't let us on the opening screen** -
  verified ~13 ways: `requestFocus` no-ops while nothing is focused yet; `moveFocus` only ever
  lands on the centre map target (even after removing its `FocusRequester`); `moveFocus(Up)`/
  `Enter` and synthetic `KeyEvent`s don't take.
- So "nothing focused, first key → search bar" is the closest reachable behaviour, and it doesn't
  violate the always-focused rule (the map is ambient; the first key goes straight to search).
- From the search bar, DOWN walks to the category chips and the map target; OK on the map target
  engages it to pan.

### The search overlay - the "can't get out of search" trap (MapScreen + SearchBar)

**Trap A: focusing the field opened the overlay.**

- `searchOpen` keys off field focus, so merely *walking* focus across the search bar flipped the
  whole screen into the search page.
- Fix (`SearchBar.kt`): in `dpadMode` the field is unfocusable (`focusProperties { canFocus }`)
  until **armed** - OK on the search **text region** arms + focuses the field. Un-focusing
  disarms. Touch phones: `dpadMode` false ⇒ byte-identical.

> The arm `clickable` goes on the text region, NOT the whole Card. On the Card it makes the
> entire bar one focus stop and **swallows the Settings gear inside it - the gear becomes
> unreachable by D-pad** (RIGHT stays on the bar). On the text region, the gear / clear / back
> IconButtons stay independently focusable.

**Trap B: no way back out (the reported bug).** Two compounding causes, both fixed:
1. A derived focus-latch (`searchHold && searchTreeFocus`) kept `searchOpen` true after
   `clearFocus()` because focus never fully left the overlay tree - so BACK could never
   close it. **Replaced with an explicit `searchExpanded` boolean**: opened on field focus,
   closed on touch-blur / BACK / once a search runs or a place is picked
   (`LaunchedEffect(results, selected, picking…)`). Deterministic; no latch to get stuck.
2. A shown soft IME holds an active InputConnection that **swallows the BACK key**, and
   `BasicTextField`'s built-in "BACK clears focus" ate the `KeyDown` before a `KeyUp`
   handler could run - so it took THREE presses to escape. Fix: in `dpadMode` don't raise the
   IME (the keypad types on hardware keys straight into the focused field), and catch BACK on
   the field via **`onPreviewKeyEvent` + `KeyDown`** (fires before the field's own handling).
   Now it's the platform-standard **two presses** (IME window eats the first to hide itself,
   the next closes).

**Trap C: DOWN couldn't leave the field.**

- With the field armed and focused, the entry rows below it (Home / Work / saved places / recent
  searches / live suggestions) were **unreachable** - a single-line `BasicTextField` swallows
  DOWN as a cursor move, so focus never left the field.
- Fix: the field's existing `onPreviewKeyEvent` handler gained a `DirectionDown` case that calls
  `focusManager.moveFocus(Down)` and consumes the key, handing focus into the rows. (It lives
  inline in `SearchBar` rather than reusing the generic `dpadFieldEscape` because it shares the
  handler with the BACK/close logic above; the effect is identical.)
- Now: OK arms → type → DOWN walks into the suggestions → OK opens one.

Touch phones are unaffected: all of the above is gated on `dpadMode`.

### Gesture alternatives

- **Nav maneuver banner** (`NavOverlays.kt`): the banner is focusable; ←/→ walk the
  upcoming steps (the key mirror of the swipe), OK resumes live guidance while previewing
  (via the preview-mode `clickable`, which OK activates).
  - The ←/→ key handler sits *before* that clickable in the modifier chain (key events bubble
    leaf→root); a standalone `focusable()` exists only when the clickable doesn't, so the banner
    is always exactly one focus stop.
- **Place sheet handle** (`PlaceSheet.kt`): the tap-only `detectTapGestures` became a
  real `clickable` (focusable, OK toggles peek/expanded; identical under touch).
  - The drag detector is untouched. Collapse-to-dismiss stays on BACK (MapScreen's peel
    `BackHandler`).
- **Directions panel** (`PlaceSheet.kt`): the handle is `clickable` with the focus ring.
  - With up to 4 route alternates the mode tabs + route list + depart options pushed the
    **Start** button off the bottom of the screen with no way to reach it - a real layout bug
    that affects **touch too**.
  - The `AnimatedVisibility` body is a `verticalScroll` Column capped at ~58% of screen height
    (`heightIn(max = screenHeightDp * 0.58)`), so the From/To header stays visible above and
    focusing (or tapping) Start scrolls it into view.
- **Photo viewer** (`PlaceSheet.kt` `PhotoGallery`): grabs focus on open (it's a
  `Dialog`, its own focus scope); ←/→ page through photos; BACK dismisses (Dialog
  default). Pinch-zoom has no key equivalent (accepted - see limitations).
- **Text fields** (Settings + reviews search): `Modifier.dpadFieldEscape()` so UP/DOWN
  leave the field instead of being trapped in it (see Core helpers, and Trap C for the
  search bar's inline equivalent).
- **Results list / sheets**: expand/collapse already had focusable buttons (chevron,
  "Hide results" bar); they gained rings. Scroll happens implicitly as focus walks the
  rows (`LazyColumn`/`verticalScroll` bring-into-view).

### Focus visibility pass

`dpadHighlight` applied to: search bar card, suggestion/shortcut/saved rows, search
result rows, "Hide results" bar, category chips, both re-center FABs, the zoom
buttons, steps-sheet rows, both sheet handles, the maneuver banner. Material
buttons/switches/dialogs keep their built-in focus indication (adequate on those
components; extend the pass if a spot proves hard to see).

The search bar's text region insets its content 10 dp inside the ring: the ring is
drawn on the Box whose edge is exactly where the first typed letter starts, so with no
inset the 2 dp stroke cut straight through that letter on every keypad-phone search.
(Ported from upstream 3b7b7bd.)

## Feature-phone screen sizes (adaptive density + device matrix)

D-pad-first means feature-phone-first, and those screens are TINY (target matrix so far: Kyocera
e4810, TCL Flip 2, Sonim XP3 - all 240x320 portrait - and the Sonim X320 at 480x854/320dpi, ~240dp
logical). "Works with a D-pad" has to hold at those sizes, not just a dev phone's panel.

- **`app/ui/AdaptiveDensity.kt`** - the app checks its screen at launch and scales its OWN density so
  it always has >= `MIN_WIDTH_DP` (360) of logical width. Standard Material layouts assume ~360dp; a
  240px feature phone is far below that, so controls crowd and clip. `AdaptiveDensity.wrap` overrides
  the effective `densityDpi` in `attachBaseContext` (chained with `AppLocale.wrap` in both
  `MainActivity` and `VelaApp`), fixing clipping across EVERY screen at once instead of per-screen. It
  ONLY shrinks small screens (>= 360dp wide = byte-for-byte no-op) and works on logical dp, so it
  generalizes across pixel resolutions. Cost: physically smaller text on a tiny panel, so `MIN_WIDTH_DP`
  is tuned VISUALLY. Verified: all three category chips fit at 240x320 (before: one), and the same at
  480x854@320.
- **Two small-screen focus bugs found + fixed on Settings** (both verified by screenshot at 240x320):
  the weak `rememberDpadAutoFocus` left the Back button UNfocused on open (fixed with robust
  `dpadAutoFocus(requester)`, which re-requests until `onFocusEvent` confirms focus landed); and DOWN
  from the focused Back button CLEARED focus instead of entering the scrolling content (Compose can't
  cross the TopAppBar->Column boundary) - fixed with an explicit `topRowFocus.requestFocus()` bridge,
  the mirror of the existing UP-from-top->Back routing.
- **`tests/devices/`** - a device matrix (`README.md`) with per-phone `findings.md` + committed
  screenshots. `tests/devices/capture.sh <id>` auto-drives the full first-run flow + core surfaces at a
  device's real geometry and saves labeled screenshots; `tests/small_screen/run_matrix.sh` runs the
  small-screen auditor at every target geometry. The auditors auto-detect the installed build, retry a
  raced uiautomator dump, verify the app reached the foreground, and warm up cold starts.

## Everything checked, file by file

| Surface | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `WelcomeScreen` | **made scrollable** - its fixed `weight(1f)`-spacer layout pushed the Get-started button off the bottom of a small (480×640) screen with no way to scroll to it (focusable-when-clipped, but invisible). Now `verticalScroll` + `heightIn(min = screen)`. |
| Onboarding prompts (`VelaRoot`) | AlertDialogs + buttons - natively focusable |
| `SearchBar` | armed-field design + BACK-out + DOWN-escape into the entry rows (Traps A/B/C above) |
| Search entry page (shortcut/saved/recent rows, menus) | `clickable` rows + `DropdownMenu`s - operable natively; rings added |
| Search results list | rows/chips/chevron operable; top-sheet drag has button equivalents; rings added |
| Map | `MapDpadController` + centre target (above) |
| Place sheet | handle fixed; action buttons/tabs/rows are Material or `clickable`; Reviews tab search field got `dpadFieldEscape` (UP-escapes + dismisses the IME) |
| Live reviews WebView (`ReviewsPanel`, "Read all reviews") | reachable (OK on the button) + exitable (BACK); ↑/↓ page-scroll the WebView; visual scroll not confirmable on the test network - see limitations |
| Directions panel | handle ring; rows/chips/buttons (incl. stop reorder) are buttons; body scroll-capped so **Start** is reachable with 4 alternates (helps touch too) |
| Route steps sheet | rows `clickable`; rings added |
| Nav (banner, controls, faster-route card, arrival card) | banner keys added; the rest are Material buttons |
| Choose-on-map | map stays pannable to position the pin (the `pickOnMap` exception); OK confirms; hold-OK sets directly; Set/Cancel buttons focusable |
| Settings | rows/switches/±steppers focusable; text fields got `dpadFieldEscape` so UP/DOWN escape them; no gesture-only widgets (no sliders) |
| Trip replay pill, notices, info cards | buttons - operable |

## Proven on-device (a keypad phone, Android 13, no touch used)

Every flow below was driven **with `adb input keyevent` D-pad keys only** and verified by
screenshot. Device facts that shaped the design, captured by on-device logging:

- `touchscreen=finger` (lies)
- `SOURCE_DPAD` only on the Virtual device
- `deviceHasKey=false`
- keypad center = `KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER` (scancode 232)
- `BACK` = 158

- **Launch**: crosshair + zoom buttons + engaged edge-ring appear immediately (dpad-first).
- **Map**: ← ↑ → ↓ pan (crosshair fixed, map slides under it); BACK disengages to the "OK:
  move the map" pill; arrows then traverse the chrome.
- **Traversal + rings**: map → category chip → search bar → results rows → place-sheet rows,
  every stop showing a visible focus ring.
- **Search**: OK arms the field, hardware typing enters text, live suggestions load, and
  **two BACK presses return to the map** (the reported trap - fixed).
- **Category search → results → place**: OK on a chip returned 20 live results; OK on a row
  opened the place sheet (photos, actions, hours all focus-reachable).
- **Directions → nav**: OK on Directions computed a live route; OK on Start began turn-by-turn.
- **Nav banner**: RIGHT/RIGHT walked steps ("Turn left onto Avenue K" → "…Nostrand Ave" →
  "Arrive"), LEFT went back, OK resumed live guidance.
- **End**: focus reached the End button; OK returned to the route preview.

**Full-function sweep.** *Every* surface of the app was driven end-to-end by D-pad to find
anything still touch-only. It surfaced five refinements (all documented above):

- the search field's DOWN-escape (Trap C)
- `dpadFieldEscape` on the Settings + reviews text fields
- Choose-on-map staying pannable
- its pill suppression
- the directions-panel scroll cap so **Start** is reachable with 4 alternates

The full-screen "Read all reviews" WebView is now D-pad-scrollable (↑/↓ → `pageUp`/`pageDown`),
with reach (OK opens) + exit (BACK closes) proven on-device; only its loaded-page visual scroll
is unconfirmable on the test network (see limitations). Nothing gesture-only remains outside the
documented limitations below.

(GPS was mocked via a `gps` test provider to give routing a valid origin; the network's
content filter otherwise leaves routing without a usable fix on this device.)

## Hardware softkeys (Yapchik) - separate from the D-pad, see docs/softkeys.md

Keypad phones also carry two hardware SOFT keys (top-left/right) with no touch or D-pad equivalent.
Those are handled by the vendored `:yapchik` engine, NOT this file's D-pad system, and are documented
in [`softkeys.md`](softkeys.md). They intercept ONLY the softkey codes (`SOFT_LEFT/RIGHT`, `MENU`,
`F1/F2`) - never the D-pad arrows/OK/BACK this file owns - so the two systems are orthogonal. The bar
gates on the SAME `isDpadFirstDevice` detector (+ `vela_force_dpad` override) as the affordances here,
so softkeys and D-pad rings agree on which devices are keypad-first. Prototype: map `Zoom -`/`Zoom +`.

## Known limitations / follow-ups (also on the ROADMAP)

- **Menus & dialogs - SOLVED (`VelaMenu` / `VelaDialog`), was the last framework wall.**
  - A Compose Material `DropdownMenu` (Popup) and `AlertDialog` (Dialog) open with their
    **window** focused but **no content Compose-focused** - Compose sets that focus only on the
    first key event, so they open un-highlighted.
  - Nothing in-app pre-places focus onto their content: **~10 approaches verified failing
    on-device** - `requestFocus()` on the item / a custom focusable Row / a `TextButton` / a
    directly-`.clickable` Text, a retry-until-`onFocusEvent`-confirms loop, an outer-scope
    delayed request, `FocusManager.moveFocus(Down)`, and a **synthetic `DPAD_DOWN` `KeyEvent`**
    dispatched to the popup's ComposeView, then its `rootView`, then again with a real DPAD input
    source.
  - **The one seam that works is a hand-built raw `Dialog` with an explicit `.focusable()`
    element** (Vela's photo gallery proves it), so both were rebuilt on it:
  - **`VelaDialog`** (`ui/VelaDialog.kt`) - drop-in two-button `AlertDialog` replacement (raw
    `Dialog` + Material-matched Surface) that **auto-focuses the dismiss/safe button** on open;
    buttons are a directly-`.focusable()` Text (the only node `requestFocus` lands on in a Dialog)
    with OK via `.onKeyEvent` and touch via `pointerInput` (not `.clickable`, which adds a 2nd
    focus target). All 7 `AlertDialog`s use it; looks identical under touch.
  - **`VelaMenu`** (`ui/VelaMenu.kt`) - drop-in `DropdownMenu` replacement. **Under touch it renders
    the ordinary anchored `DropdownMenu` byte-identical**; under D-pad a raw-`Dialog` chooser whose
    **first item is focused on open**. `VelaMenu(expanded, onDismissRequest){ item("A"){…}; item("B"){…} }`.
    All 6 menus use it.

  **NEVER use a bare `DropdownMenu`/`AlertDialog` for new D-pad UI - use `VelaMenu`/`VelaDialog`.**
  Proven on-device:
  - onboarding dialogs auto-focus "Not now"
  - the place-sheet ⋮ auto-focuses "Set as Home"
  - the share menu auto-focuses "Google Maps link"
  - OK selects, DOWN/UP walk, arrows move between dialog buttons, BACK dismisses.
- **Off-screen initial-focus targets (small screens).**
  - Compose won't move focus to an element it can't bring into view, so a primary control that
    starts **below the fold** can't be auto-focused on open (e.g. the Welcome screen's
    Get-started button on a 480×640 keypad screen).
  - `Modifier.dpadAutoFocus()` (the retry-until-`onFocusEvent`-confirms variant) lands it when
    it's on-screen; when it's off-screen the D-pad user presses DOWN to reveal + focus it.
  - Force-scrolling it into view on open was tried and reverted - it hides the welcome intro on a
    once-seen screen.
  - `rememberDpadAutoFocus()` (the simpler requester) is fine for on-screen targets; use
    `dpadAutoFocus()` when a target may be off-screen.
- **Platform dialogs are AOSP, not Vela UI.** "Depart at / Arrive by" opens
  `android.app.TimePickerDialog`, and confirmations use platform `AlertDialog`s - these take
  window focus and are D-pad-navigable by Android itself, outside Vela's Compose focus system.
- **Text entry relies on hardware keys.** In `dpadMode` Vela focuses the field but does
  NOT raise the soft IME - the keypad's physical keys type straight into the focused field.
  - A device with neither a hardware keyboard nor a D-pad-navigable IME would have no way to
    type; that's out of scope (such a device isn't "D-pad operable" to begin with).
- **Live reviews panel** (`ReviewsPanel`, the full-screen "Read all reviews" WebView) -
  **D-pad-scrollable.**
  - A raw WebView's default D-pad handling hops focus between the page's links instead of
    scrolling, useless for reading.
  - In `fullScreen` mode the WebView maps ↑/↓ to `pageUp`/`pageDown` (stable WebView APIs) via an
    `OnKeyListener`, and `requestFocus()`es on page-finish so it receives the keys - scrolling
    deterministically regardless of the page's focusables.
  - The handler only fires on hardware D-pad keys (inert under touch) and only in `fullScreen`
    (the inline scroll-sync path is untouched).
  - **Proven on-device:** the panel is REACHABLE (OK on the "All N reviews" button) and EXITABLE
    (hardware BACK, via the `Dialog`'s `BackHandler`, which fires even while the WebView holds
    focus - so it can never trap you).
  - **Not visually confirmable on the test device:** its network content filter throttles the
    reviews carve (the panel holds the WebView at `alpha=0` until "ready"), so it falls back to
    the native reviews list; the page-scroll wiring is verified-by-construction, not
    pixel-verified.
- **Photo pinch-zoom** has no key equivalent (view-only; ←/→ paging works).
- **Map tilt** (two-finger drag) has no key equivalent; browse/nav don't need it.
- **Tuning** still worth a pass: pan step (0.22 of view), OK-hold threshold (500 ms),
  focus-ring visibility in both themes. Values felt right on the test device.
- On a touch phone in `dpadMode` (external keyboard), the first *tap* on the search field
  can be eaten while the input mode flips back to Touch (tap again). Cosmetic; D-pad-first
  devices unaffected.

## Merge-with-upstream policy (how this stays rebasable)

The whole feature follows these rules - keep following them when extending it:

1. **New behaviour lives in new files**: `DpadFocus.kt`, `MapDpadController.kt`,
   `docs/dpad.md`. Upstream can't conflict with files it doesn't have.
2. **Edits to shared files are additive and anchored**, never restructuring: one
   contiguous, commented import block per file ("docs/dpad.md" marker); new modifiers
   *inserted into* existing chains; new state vars added next to related ones. The one
   near-refactor (naming the map click listener `handleTap`) changed only the lambda
   header and three `return@` labels - the body is untouched, so upstream diffs apply cleanly.
3. **Touch paths are never forked** - D-pad code calls the same lambdas/flags/state
   the gesture handlers use. Upstream fixes to tap resolution, reroute-on-pan,
   nav-zoom overrides etc. automatically apply to D-pad input.
4. **Everything is gated on `dpadMode`/`noTouch`** where it could change touch
   behaviour; with a touchscreen and no key input, the UI is byte-identical.

If a pull does conflict, the conflicts will be in the small anchored insertions -
re-apply them around the upstream change and re-read this file's design section to
confirm the invariants still hold.
